EPISODE 1 - WINTERFELL
TITLE SEQUENCE
EXT. WINTER TOWN - DAY

A young boy runs through a snowy forest woods, he crosses a shallow stream and then runs through the streets of the winter town. As he runs through the town, pigs squeal and donkeys bray. He reaches the street and stands among a large crowd, struggling to see what is happening on the road. A man steps aside and the boy pushes through. Pan up to see ARYA STARK smiling as she watches the boy run through. A large army is marching along the road and the boy continues to run alongside them. He finds a tree and climbs up it to get a good view. Pan up to see the army marching along the road from the winter town up to Winterfell. A man's shout can be heard, and the boy turns to face the rear of the army. Pan around to see the large army of DAENERYS TARGARYEN. Cut to the middle of the army marching through the streets, DAENERYS and JON SNOW atop their horses. Cut to ARYA, she looks at JON and smiles, she starts to speak but says nothing as he rides by. Many people of the town stare at the troops marching through. SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE is on a horse of his own with the army. ARYA sees him but says nothing. GENDRY is also riding on a horse, ARYA looks at him and smiles as he goes past.

CUT TO: HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE

A carriage is among the army and it carries within it TYRION LANNISTER who sits opposite LORD VARYS.

TYRION: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.

VARYS: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?

TYRION: Because I have balls, and you don't.

The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other. The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at JON and DAENERYS as they ride past.

JON: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring as DAENERYS’ dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. ARYA emerges from the crowd smiling. The dragons swoop over Winterfell and SANSA STARK watches them fly overhead from the walls of Winterfell.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE

DAENERYS and JON ride into Winterfell towards a crowd of people standing within. BRAN STARK is sitting at the front of the crowd. JON rides up to him and dismounts his horse. He walks up to BRAN and kisses him on the forehead.

JON: Look at you.

JON sniffles

JON: You're a man.

BRAN: Almost.

JON looks at him quizzically and then up to SANSA who is standing next to him. He walks up to her and gives her a hug. JORAH MORMONT and DAENERYS watch from behind.

JON: Where's Arya?

SANSA: Lurking somewhere.

JON turns around to DAENERYS and she walks over to him.

JON: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

DAENERYS: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.

SANSA looks at DAENERYS hesitantly.

SANSA: Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

BRAN: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.

DAENERYS turns to look at BRAN.

BRAN: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.

SANSA, DAENERYS and JON all look at each other concerned.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL

SANSA: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?

A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.

UMBER: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

He stops and then turns to look at JON.

UMBER: And my lord.

He stops again and then turns to look at DAENERYS.

UMBER: And my queen. Sorry.

SANSA: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

UMBER bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.

JON: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.

MAESTER WOLKAN: At once, Your Grace.


WOLKAN exits.

LYANNA MORMONT: "Your Grace."

LYANNA stands up and walks forwards

LYANNA: But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.

People start murmuring.

LYANNA: A lord? Nothing at all?

JON: It's not important.

LYANNA: Not important? We named you King in the North.

People start cheering.

MAN: King of the North!

JON: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.

People murmur. TYRION stands up and walks to the centre of the room.

TYRION: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.

People grumble and yell out indistinctly.

TYRION: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.

SANSA: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?

DAENERYS: Whatever they want.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon and GENDRY catches it before it hits the ground.

GENDRY: Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.

MAN 1: Sorry ’bout that.

GENDRY climbs into the back of one of the wagons.

GENDRY: Are these the last of the wagons?

The camera cuts to TYRION who is watching over the courtyard.

MAN 2 (O.S.): Aye.

GENDRY (O.S.): All right, let's get it all to the forges.

TYRION walks up to SANSA and YOHN ROYCE.

TYRION: My lord. My lady.

ROYCE turns to look at SANSA, who nods back.

ROYCE: My lady.

ROYCE exits.

TYRION: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.

SANSA: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.

TYRION: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.

SANSA: It had its moments.

They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARATHEON.

SANSA: Apologies for leaving like that.

TYRION: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

SANSA: We both survived.

TYRION: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.

There is a short silence.

TYRION: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-

SANSA: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?

TYRION: She did.

SANSA: And you believed her?

TYRION: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.

SANSA: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

SANSA exits and TYRION turns to see BRAN staring at him from the courtyard.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD

JON stands next to the weirwood tree and looks at the face carved into the trunk

ARYA (O.S.): You used to be taller.

JON turns around to see ARYA standing near him.

JON: How did you sneak up on me?

ARYA: How did you survive a knife through the heart?

JON: I didn't.

ARYA laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their hug, JON looks down to see ARYA's sword and scoffs in disbelief.

JON: You still have it.

ARYA unsheathes her sword.

ARYA: Needle.

JON: Have you ever used it?

ARYA: Once or twice.

ARYA puts Needle away. JON pulls out his sword, Longclaw, and hands it to ARYA.

ARYA: Valyrian steel.

JON: Jealous?

ARYA scoffs.

ARYA: Too heavy for me.

JON sheaths his sword and puts his hand on ARYA's shoulder.

JON: Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.

ARYA: She doesn't like your queen, does she?

JON: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

ARYA: She's the smartest person I've ever met.

JON: Now you're defending her?

JON chuckles.

JON: You?

ARYA: I'm defending our family. So is she.

JON: Yeah. I'm her family too.

ARYA hugs JON.

ARYA: Don't forget that.
EXT – KING'S LANDING - DAY

Pan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.

QYBURN: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.

CERSEI's lips curl.

CERSEI: Good.

She exits as the camera pans around. EURON GREYJOY's Iron Fleet is out at sea and QYBURN turns to look out at them.

CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP

EURON smiles and stares out at King's Landing from his ship. He walks in the cabin

CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP - CABIN
EURON walks inside and past YARA GREYJOY who is tied to a post in the cabin.

YARA: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

EURON walks up to her and crouches down.

EURON: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.

EURON chuckles and pops the lid off his drink.

EURON: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?

He sighs.

EURON: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.

YARA: Are we in King's Landing?

EURON: Mm.

He turns and offers his drink.

YARA: You picked the losing side.

EURON: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

He stands up and turns to look her in the eyes.

EURON: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

EURON exits.

CUT TO: RED KEEP – GREAT HALL

CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, EURON and HARRY STRICKLAND stand opposite her.

CERSEI: Twenty-thousand men, is it?

HARRY: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

EURON: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

CERSEI: Horses?

HARRY: Two thousand.

CERSEI: And elephants?

HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

CERSEI: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

CERSEI: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

HARRY: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

HARRY bows and exits.

EURON: Am I most welcome here?

CERSEI: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.

EURON: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest

EURON starts to walk forward but GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE steps in the way. EURON stops but leans towards CERSEI.

EURON: I was hoping we could talk in private.

CERSEI: After the war. That was our agreement.

EURON: Wars sometimes last years.

CERSEI: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.

CERSEI stands and starts to walk out.

EURON: How?

CERSEI stops.

EURON: I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.

CERSEI turns around to face EURON.

CERSEI: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.

EURON: They were lesser men.

CERSEI walks towards the door but halts. She turns around and looks at EURON. EURON chuckles and follows CERSEI, staring at THE MOUNTAIN as he walks past.

CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL

BRONN is on a bed in brothel with 3 women around him, DIRAH, CRAYAH and MAREI.

DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

CRAYAH: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

DIRAH: Archie, was it?

CRAYAH: And William.

DIRAH: Tall handsome William?

CRAYAH: Yeah, tall handsome William.

DIRAH: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

BRONN: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

CRAYAH: Did you?

BRONN: Nearly killed it.

MAREI: That's brave.

MAREI pushes BRONN back and climbs on top of him, CRAYAH and DIRAH climb on the bed either side.

CRAYAH: That boy Eddie.

DIRAH: The ginger?

CRAYAH: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.

DIRAH: How does he sleep with no eyelids?

BRONN: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

QYBURN (O.S.): Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

BRONN sits up and all four of them look at QYBURN who is standing in the doorway.

BRONN: You're kidding me.

QYBURN: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.

BRONN sighs and removes MAREI from his lap.

BRONN: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.

BRONN stands up and starts dressing himself. CRAYAH walks up to QYBURN.

CRAYAH: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.

The three women leave.

QYBURN: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

BRONN chokes on his drink and coughs.

BRONN: Which girl?

QYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

BRONN: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.

QYBURN: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

BRONN: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-

QYBURN: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

BRONN: Yeah, well, good luck with that.

QYBURN: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-

A guard brings in a large crossbow, one that TYRION had previously used to murder his, JAIME's and CERSEI's father, TYWIN LANNISTER.

QYBURN: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

BRONN: That fucking family.

QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

QYBURN walks up to BRONN and holds out the crossbow. After a short silence, BRONN takes it. QYBURN exits whilst BRONN looks at the crossbow in his hands.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS

CERSEI is standing behind a chair and sighs.

CERSEI: I wanted those elephants.

The camera pans to reveal EURON getting dressed. He sighs and CERSEI walks around the chair and sits down.

EURON: So, how do I compare to the fat king?

CERSEI: You're insulting my late husband?

EURON walks up to her and whispers in her ear.

EURON: Are you offended?

CERSEI: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

EURON: And the Kingslayer?

CERSEI glares at EURON.

CERSEI: You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

EURON chuckles.

EURON: Life is boring.

CERSEI: You're not boring, I'll give you that.

EURON smiles and walks up to CERSEI, standing over her.

EURON: Do I please the queen?

CERSEI: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.

EURON chuckles.

CERSEI: But now I want to be alone.

EURON leans down and speaks softly to CERSEI.

EURON: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

EURON exits and tears start to form in CERSEI's eyes.

CUT TO: IRON FLEET

A door can be heard open and then close, a bow string creaks and then an arrow pierces a man's head. More and more of EURON's men drop dead and a group of men walk over their bodies. YARA is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. THEON GREYJOY walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties YARA. THEON helps YARA to her feet before she turns to him and headbutts him. THEON falls to the floor, stunned, and YARA extends a hand. THEON grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin.

CUT TO: THEON'S SHIPS

Three ships from the Iron Fleet sail together.

YARA (O.S.): Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

YARA and THEON stand on deck next to one another.

YARA: We can take our home back.

THEON: Daenerys went north.

YARA: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.

THEON pauses and sighs.

THEON: You're my queen. I go where you command.

YARA turns to him.

YARA: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.

THEON turns to YARA.

THEON: What is dead may never die.

They embrace and YARA leans to his ear.

YARA: But kill the bastards anyway.
EXT. WINTERFELL - DAY

DAENERYS' army are camped outside the walls of Winterfell and wagons and horses enter the front gate.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE

Inside the gate, WOLKAN is greeting ALYS KARSTARK as the KARSTARKS arrive.

WOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me

WOLKAN and ALYS exit, VARYS, DAVOS SEAWORTH and TYRION are watching on.

VARYS: The Karstarks.

TYRION: One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.

DAVOS: Can't argue with that.

The three men start walking with each other.

DAVOS: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

TYRION: And our queen is grateful.

DAVOS: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

TYRION stops and thinks. He then catches up with DAVOS and VARYS who continued to walk.

TYRION: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

DAVOS looks out over the castle wall.

DAVOS: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

VARYS and TYRION walk forward to look over the wall with DAVOS, they see JON and DAENERYS standing and talking with each other.

TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.

VARYS: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

TYRION: I'm not that old.

TYRION looks up at VARYS and then at DAVOS.

TYRION: Not as old as him.

DAVOS chuckles.

TYRION: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

VARYS: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

TYRION: What is that?

VARYS: Nothing lasts.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL

JON and DAENERYS walk together as men shout indistinctly in the background.

DAENERYS: Your sister doesn't like me.

They both stop and turn to one another.

JON: She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

DAENERYS: She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-

Three Dothraki men ride up to DAENERYS.

DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): How many today?

DOTHRAKI MAN #1: Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

The Dothraki men ride away.

JON (speaking the Common Tongue): What's the matter?

DAENERYS: The dragons are barely eating.

DAENERYS walks off and JON follows.
EXT. FLAT CLEARING

JON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.

JON: What's wrong with them?

DAENERYS: They don't like the North.

She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at JON and gets close. DAENERYS climbs on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL.

DAENERYS: Go on.

JON looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do.

JON: I don't know how to ride a dragon.

DAENERYS: Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

JON: What if he doesn't want me to?

DAENERYS: Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

Defeated, JON walks around the side of RHAEGAL and then climbs on top whilst grunting.

JON: What do I hold onto?

DAENERYS: Whatever you can.

JON grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. DAENERYS watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing JON to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past TYRION, DAVOS and VARYS who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so DAENERYS instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to JON. JON and DAENERYS, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.

JON: You've completely ruined horses for me.

DAENERYS giggles and then notices a large waterfall, they stop.

DAENERYS: We could stay a thousand years-

She turns back to look at JON.

DAENERYS: No one would find us.

JON: We'd be pretty old.

DAENERYS chuckles and the two walk up to one another.

JON: It's cold up here for a southern girl.

DAENERYS: So keep your queen warm.

JON pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing JON to pull away.

DAENERYS: Don't be afraid.

They smile and continue their kiss in each other's embrace. JON opens his eyes to see DROGON staring at them.
INT. WINTERFELL – DAY

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES

GENDRY amongst other men occupy the forge, using the furnaces to create weapons from dragonglass

MAN 1: Gendry?

MAN 2: He's here.

GENDRY hears and grabs a large axe made from dragonglass. He hands it over to SANDOR.

GENDRY: It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

SANDOR: You're saying you're good, is that it?

GENDRY: I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-

SANDOR: You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?

ARYA (O.S.): Leave him be.

GENDRY and SANDOR turn to see ARYA and stare at her.

SANDOR: I heard you were here. You left me to die.

ARYA: First I robbed you.

SANDOR stands up and walks over to her, not breaking eye-contact.

SANDOR: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.

SANDOR exits and GENDRY walks up to ARYA.

ARYA: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.

GENDRY: Yeah, thanks. So have you.

He pauses.

GENDRY: I mean, you look good.

ARYA: Thanks. So do you.

GENDRY pauses, he then walks away whilst still talking to her.

GENDRY: It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

ARYA follows.

ARYA: Stay close to that forge, then.

GENDRY: Is that a command, Lady Stark?

ARYA: Don't call me that.

GENDRY: As you wish, milady.

She smiles and chuckles.

ARYA: Here's my wish.

ARYA hands GENDRY a piece of parchment with a detachable spear drawn on it, with a dragonglass tip.

ARYA: Can you make it?

GENDRY: What do you need something like this for?

ARYA: Can you make it or not?

GENDRY: You already have a sword. What's that?

ARYA removes a Valyrian steel dagger from her person and hands it to him.

GENDRY: It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.

ARYA smirks and takes the dagger back.

ARYA: You don't know any other rich girls.

ARYA walks off before turning back and smiling and then back around again without breaking stride.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS

SANSA is reading a letter when there is a knock on the door.

SANSA: Come in.

The door creaks open and then shuts. JON walks in before stopping next to her. SANSA sighs.

SANSA: Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

JON: "House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't that what he said?

SANSA: "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.

SANSA stands up and walks a bit before stopping and turning to look at him

SANSA: "The King in the North."

JON: I told you we needed allies.

SANSA: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

JON: I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

SANSA: And a Targaryen queen.

JON sighs.

JON: Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.

They fall silent and JON sighs.

JON: Do you have any faith in me at all?

SANSA: You know I do.

JON: She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.

SANSA sighs.

SANSA: No, she's much prettier.

JON scoffs.

SANSA: Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?

He looks up at her.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY

A door creaks open and then shuts as DAENERYS and JORAH enter the library. They walk to where SAMWELL TARLY sits and JORAH nods in his direction. DAENERYS clears her throat.

SAMWELL: Oh!

Startled, SAMWELL stands up and dusts himself off.

DAENERYS: So you're the man?

SAMWELL: Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?

DAENERYS: The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

JORAH: They could, they just wouldn't.

DAENERYS: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.

SAMWELL: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Well, there must be something I could give you.

SAMWELL nods.

SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.

DAENERYS: For what crime?

SAMWELL: Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

JORAH and DAENERYS both smile to themselves.

SAMWELL: And also a sword.

DAENERYS looks at him, confused.

DAENERYS: From the Citadel?

SAMWELL: From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.

DAENERYS' face drops and she looks concerned.

SAMWELL: It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.

DAENERYS: Not Randyll Tarly?

SAMWELL: You know him?

He looks at her, surprised. JORAH looks guilty.

DAENERYS: I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.

JORAH looks down as SAMWELL tried to hold it together. He gulps.

SAMWELL: Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.

DAENERYS' face is stern.

DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.

SAMWELL's lips start quivering and his breathe becomes shaky.

SAMWELL: Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- May I?

DAENERYS: Of course.

SAMWELL exits quickly, and DAENERYS and JORAH look at each other.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

SAMWELL heads outside before being startled by a horse carrying a wagon. He stops and sees BRAN staring at him from across the courtyard. He walks over.

SAMWELL: What are you doing out here?

BRAN: Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.

SAMWELL shakes his head.

SAMWELL: No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?

BRAN: I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS

JON blows out a candle and stands back to look at his father, EDDARD STARK's, statue. He sighs and hears a man grunting and a thud. He walks around the corner to see SAMWELL stand up.

JON: Sam?

SAMWELL: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

JON grabs SAMWELL and hugs him tightly.

JON: Were you hiding from me?

SAMWELL: Of course not.

JON: What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

He looks at SAMWELL's face and sees he is worried.

JON: What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?

SAMWELL: She's good.

JON: Little Sam?

SAMWELL: Don't you know?

JON: Know what?

SAMWELL: Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.

JON looks at SAMWELL, shocked at the news he was hearing.

SAMWELL: She didn't tell you.

JON: I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.

SAMWELL: Would you have done it?

JON: Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

SAMWELL: You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

JON: I wasn't a king.

SAMWELL: But you were. You've always been.

JON: I gave up my crown, Sam.

JON starts walking away, SAMWELL follows.

JON: I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.

SAMWELL: I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

JON stops immediately, pauses and turns around.

SAMWELL: Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.

JON: What are you talking about?

SAMWELL: Your mother was Lyanna Stark.

JON exhales sharply.

SAMWELL: And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.

JON walks up to SAMWELL:

JON: My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.

SAMWELL: No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.

JON takes a couple of steps back whilst breathing heavily.

JON: Daenerys is our queen.

SAMWELL: She shouldn't be.

JON: That's treason.

SAMWELL: It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
EXT. LAST HEARTH - NIGHT

BERIC DONDARRION and TORMUND with a group of others walk into Last Hearth to find it deserted. BERIC walks in first. Suddenly everyone screams as they find DOLOROUS EDD and others of the Night's Watch.

EDD: Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

TORMUND: I've always had blue eyes!

Everyone pauses and lowers their weapons.

BERIC: Did you find anyone?

EDD leads BERIC and TORMUND through a large hall, faintly illuminated by BERIC's ignited sword. When they reach the far wall there is a young boy impaled on the wall with several spirals of limbs surrounding him.

EDD: The Umber boy.

BERIC: It's a message. From the Night King.

TORMUND: His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.

EDD: We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.

TORMUND: If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.

UMBER's eyes open.

TORMUND: We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-

UMBER starts shrieking, the three men start clamouring and BERIC shoves his sword in the boy, both igniting him and causing him to shriek even louder. The shrieking eventually stops, but not before the entire mosaic of appendages has been engulfed by flames.
EXT. WINTER TOWN - DAY

Men are marching along the long road up to Winterfell, a cloaked figure rides a horse.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

The cloaked man rides the horse up to the stable and dismounts as men around shout indistinctly. He removes his hood and JAIME LANNISTER's face is revealed. He sighs and looks around the courtyard before BRAN catches his eye. JAIME stares at him in disbelief at the camera zooms in on BRAN's face.
CREDITS

EPISODE 2 - A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS
TITLE SEQUENCE
INT. WINTERFELL - DAY

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL

JAIME LANNISTER stands in the Great Hall of Winterfell.

DAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.

The camera cuts to a wide view of the hall and we see a multitude of guards placed around the room and the many who ally with House Stark. Sitting at the head of the room is DAENERYS in the centre of a long table; JON SNOW sits on her left and SANSA STARK on her right and JAIME is standing in the middle of the room facing DAENERYS. On the left of the room there is a shorter table where TYRION LANNISTER, LORD VARYS, MISSANDEI and JORAH MORMONT sit. On the right there is another table where DAVOS SEAWORTH, LYANNA MORMONT, LORD YOHN ROYCE, ALYS KARSTARK and BRIENNE OF TARTH sit

DAENERYS: Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.

JAIME’s eyes lowered.

DAENERYS: He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.

She pauses.

DAENERYS: Your sister pledged to send her army north.

JAIME: She did.

DAENERYS: I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.

TYRION looks up at his brother and JAIME looks back.

JAIME: She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.

DAENERYS turned her glare towards TYRION.

JAIME: She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.

DAENERYS: "We"?

JAIME: I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.

TYRION steps forwards towards DAENERYS.

TYRION: Your Grace, I know my brother-

DAENERYS: Like you knew your sister?

TYRION: He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

DAENERYS: Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.

TYRION looks to JON and SANSA.

SANSA: You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.

JAIME: Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.

BRAN: The things we do for love.

DAENERYS, SANSA and JON all turn slowly to look at BRAN who sits to the side of SANSA. JAIME looks at him and BRAN maintains eye-contact.

DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?

JAIME: Because this goes beyond loyalty.

He looks around to see BRIENNE, then turns back.

JAIME: This is about survival.

TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS. BRIENNE then stands up.

BRIENNE: You don't know me well, Your Grace.

She walks from behind her table to stand in the middle of the Hall beside JAIME.

BRIENNE: But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.

She then addresses SANSA.

BRIENNE: Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

SANSA looks down and then back up at BRIENNE.

SANSA: You vouch for him?


BRIENNE: I do.

SANSA: You would fight beside him?

BRIENNE: I would.

SANSA: I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.

DAENERYS: What does the Warden of the North say about it?

She turns to JON who sighs.

JON: We need every man we can get.

The room falls silent as DAENERYS thinks to herself.

DAENERYS: Very well.

TYRION exhales sharply in relief. GREY WORM picks up JAIME’s sword, walks over to him, handing it over aggressively.

JAIME: Thank you, Your Grace.

DAENERYS stands up and the rest of the room does as she does. SANSA exits. DAENERYS turns to JON who exits after his sister. DAENERYS then exits followed by TYRION, VARYS, JORAH and MISSANDEI. JAIME then catches BRIENNE’s eye as she leaves and then he ends up looking at BRAN again who mimics his stare.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – HALLWAY

DAENERYS walks along the hallway outside the hall followed by TYRION, VARYS and JORAH.

DAENERYS: Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.

TYRION: I was a fool.

DAENERYS: Not for the first time.

DAENERYS stops walking and turns to TYRION.

DAENERYS: Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.

DAENERYS exits. TYRION turns to VARYS and JORAH.

TYRION: I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES

Men chatter indistinctly as they forge the weapons. GENDRY walks into frame, dumping dragonglass out of a bucket. He then walks up to furnace and pulls out some dragonglass, moulding it and then dousing it in a bucket of water. ARYA STARK walks towards him. As the steam rises from the bucket she catches his eye.

GENDRY: Don't you have something better to do?

ARYA: You make my weapon yet?

GENDRY: Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

GENDRY hands her a small axe with a blade made of dragonglass.

ARYA: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.

GENDRY grabs the axe and brings it down harshly on a wooden stump.

GENDRY: It's strong enough.

GENDRY moves to a pile of dragonglass spearheads and checks on it, ARYA follows.

GENDRY: It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.

ARYA: Are you going to be down in the crypt?

GENDRY: No, but-

ARYA: But you're a fighter.

He glances up at her.

GENDRY: I've done my share.

ARYA: You've fought them?

GENDRY: I did. Some of them.

ARYA: How many?

GENDRY: A few. That was enough.

ARYA: What are they like?

GENDRY: Bad. Really bad.

ARYA: "Really bad"?

She walks behind him and around the other side of the table so she is facing him.

ARYA: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad." What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?

GENDRY: Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-This is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.

ARYA picks up one of the spearheads, turning it in her hand.

ARYA: I know Death.

She throws the spearhead, narrowly missing a blacksmith’s head. GENDRY exhales, staring in disbelief at the dragonglass impaled on the wooden beam.

ARYA: He's got many faces.

She tosses another landing next to the first. The blacksmith quickly runs away. GENDRY slowly turns back to ARYA who picks up a third spearhead.

ARYA: I look forward to seeing this one.

She throws it and it lands with the first two. GENDRY chuckles to himself and ARYA walks back round the table and past GENDRY.

ARYA: My weapon?

GENDRY: I'll get right on it.

ARYA walks off as GENDRY watches. He smirks to himself.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD

The camera pans from behind a tree to show BRAN sitting in his wheelchair facing the weirwood tree. JAIME walks towards him. He stops a couple feet from him and looks down.

JAIME: I'm sorry for what I did to you.

BRAN turns his head towards JAIME.

BRAN: You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.

JAIME walks around in front of BRAN.

JAIME: I'm not that person anymore.

BRAN: You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.

JAIME: You're not?

BRAN: No. I'm something else now.

JAIME: You're not angry at me.

BRAN: I'm not angry at anyone.

JAIME: Why didn't you tell them?

BRAN: You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.

JAIME nods and raises an eyebrow.

JAIME: What about afterwards?

BRAN: How do you know there is an afterwards?

JAIME stares at BRAN.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

All of the northerners are busy building defences in preparation for the army of the dead as TYRION walks past. JAIME approaches him.

TYRION: Well, here we are.

JAIME: Yes, here we are.

TYRION: Together again.

A man standing above them clears his throat and then spits on the floor beside them.

TYRION: And the masses rejoice.

JAIME: How do they feel about their new queen?

TYRION: She's your new queen too.

They start walking together.

TYRION: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.

JAIME: And she is? Different?

TYRION: She is.

JAIME: You're sure about her?

TYRION: I am.

JAIME: She didn't seem sure about you.

TYRION: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.

JAIME: Hmm.

TYRION: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.

They stop walking and TYRION turns to look up at JAIME.

TYRION: Was she lying about the baby too?

JAIME: No, that part is real.

TYRION thinks to himself and they both start walking again.

JAIME: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.

They start to walk up a staircase and TYRION turns to look at JAIME.

JAIME: What?

TYRION: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.

TYRION walks ahead as JAIME remains in the same spot. After a couple seconds, he follows. They both walk along the walls of castle looking over the courtyard.

TYRION: So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-

BOTH: A girl's mouth around-

JAIME: Your cock.

TYRION: My cock.

TYRION smiles up at JAIME.

TYRION: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

JAIME notices something whilst TYRION continues to talk and walks off.

TYRION: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.

TYRION glances up where JAIME was and notices he is gone, he looks behind to see JAIME looking over the wall. The camera cuts to show BRIENNE walking outside the walls among the Unsullied.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE

GREY WORM is seen testing out the traps around the castle as other Unsullied and northerners work around him. JAIME walks out the front gate. We see PODRICK PAYNE training with a soldier as BRIENNE watches on, smiling proudly. JAIME stands next to her and she glances at him.

BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.

JAIME: Lady Brienne.

PODRICK blocks the soldier and pushes him back, bettering him. They continue to fight with their swords.

JAIME: He's come a long way.

BRIENNE: He's all right. Still has a lot to learn.

BRIENNE starts walking away and JAIME follows.

JAIME: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

BRIENNE: I am. It's, uh-It's good ground.

JAIME: It is.

BRIENNE: The rise, it should give us some advantage.

They stop walking.

BRIENNE: If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.

JAIME: Yes, I think you're right.

BRIENNE quickly turns to face JAIME.

BRIENNE: What are you doing?

JAIME: What?

BRIENNE: I think you know.

JAIME: I truly don't.

BRIENNE: We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.

JAIME: You want me to insult you?

BRIENNE: No!

JAIME: Good.

He pauses.

JAIME: I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.

BRIENNE goes silent and looks down briefly. She returns his gaze.

BRIENNE: I better get back.

BRIENNE walks off, leaving JAIME standing alone.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS

DAENERYS’ door opens and JORAH walks in.

JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi.

DAENERYS: Have you done something to offend me?

JORAH: Many things.

DAENERYS: Long ago and long forgiven.

JORAH: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.

DAENERYS: When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

JORAH: You made the right choice.

DAENERYS: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.

JORAH: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.

JORAH chuckles.

JORAH: But the mind behind all those words-

DAENERYS: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.

JORAH: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.

DAENERYS: You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?

JORAH: I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY

DAENERYS walks into the library.

ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.

The camera pans to show ROYCE and SANSA sitting at a table together.

SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.

They both notice DAENERYS’ presence and stand up.

DAENERYS: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.

ROYCE looks at SANSA who nods, granting him leave. ROYCE walks towards DAENERYS, bows and then exits. DAENERYS turns to watch him leave before turning back.

DAENERYS: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.

SANSA: Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.

DAENERYS: I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.

SANSA: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.

DAENERYS: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.

She starts walking towards SANSA.

DAENERYS: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.

SANSA: You never should have either.

DAENERYS: I thought he knew his sister.

SANSA: Families are complicated.

DAENERYS: Ours certainly have been.

They both sit down in the seats SANSA and ROYCE were previously occupying.

SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.

DAENERYS: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.

SANSA returns her uneasy smile.

DAENERYS: And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.

SANSA: He loves you, you know that.

DAENERYS: That bothers you.

SANSA: Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.

DAENERYS: All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom?

SANSA scoffs; she then leans forward and places her hand on DAENERYS’ hand.

SANSA: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.

DAENERYS places her other hand on top of SANSA’s.

DAENERYS: I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.

SANSA: Who was the first?

DAENERYS: Someone taller.

They both chuckle with one another.

SANSA: And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?

DAENERYS: I take the Iron Throne.

SANSA: What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?

DAENERYS removes her hand and looks away from SANSA. MAESTER WOLKAN enters the library.

WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.

DAENERYS turns in her seat, agitated.

DAENERYS: What is it?

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL

WOLKAN leads DAENERYS and SANSA into the great hall, where we see THEON GREYJOY standing in the centre of the hall surrounded by many of the Ironborn. DAENERYS looks shocked, THEON walks up to her and bends his knee.

THEON: My queen.

DAENERYS: Your sister?

THEON: She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.

DAENERYS: But why aren't you with her?

THEON looks at SANSA.

THEON: I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.

SANSA walks up to THEON quickly and hugs him tightly. THEON hugs back.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – COURTYARD

Many northerners wait in line to be served food. DAVOS is filling the bowls.

MAN: Milord, we're not soldiers.

DAVOS: You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.

MAN: Thank you.

He nods towards DAVOS and walks off with his bowl.

GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.

The camera pans to show GILLY leading a young woman and an older couple, showing them where they will stay during the battle.

GILLY: They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.

WOMAN: Thank you.

TEELA, a young girl, walks up to where the food is being served and holds her bowl up. DAVOS has his back turned.

TEELA: Which way should I go?

DAVOS turns back around and looks at her.

DAVOS: Which way do you want to go?

TEELA: All the children will be going below when the time comes.

GILLY overhears the conversation and starts to walk over.

TEELA: But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.

DAVOS takes her bowl and fills it up as GILLY sits down next to her.

GILLY: That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.

DAVOS: I'm sure a lot of people would.

He hands her bowl back to her.

TEELA: All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.

TEELA walks off and DAVOS smiles at GILLY. A horn is then blared and the gates are opened as the remaining members of the nights watch return with TORMUND GIANTSBANE and BERIC DONDARRION. SAMWELL TARLY greets DOLOROUS EDD who has just returned. JON sees them and quickly heads over. Before he can embrace EDD, TORMUND hugs him first.

TORMUND: My little crow.

JON: I thought we'd lost you.

TORMUND: Almost.

JON turns to hug EDD. He then turn to BERIC and shakes his hand.

JON: How did you find each other?

EDD: We met up at the Last Hearth.

TORMUND: The dead got there first.

JON: The Umbers?

BERIC: Fighting for the Night King now.

TORMUND: We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.

JON: How long do we have?

TORMUND: Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

JON looks at SAMWELL with a concerned look. TORMUND looks back over his shoulder, surveying his surroundings.

TORMUND: The big woman still here?
EXT. WINTERFELL - DAY

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALLS

Northern soldiers jog around the walls of Winterfell

JON (V.O.): They're coming.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Men are removing dragonglass weapons from carriages and handing to soldier. The camera pans and GENDRY lifts a dragonglass axe up and hands it to a man.

JON (V.O.): We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE

The Unsullied pull ropes, causing a large boulder to be thrown into the air by a large trebuchet. More soldiers march out of the gates of Winterfell.

JON(V.O.): But there are too many of them.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS

Archers walk up to the edge of the battlements with their bow and arrows. We see a man stretch the bow string

JON (V.O.): Far too many.

A horse neighs and the man looks up over the wall.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE

The Dothraki ride along the outside of the wall as the camera pans past the trench of spikes used to defend from the Army of the Dead.

JON (V.O.): Our enemy doesn't tire.

The camera moves farther down until it reaches a gap in the trench outside the gate, the Dothraki ride through the center as Unsullied soldiers emerge from the gate.

JON (V.O.): Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY

In the library, a large table has a map of Winterfell laid out over it, with various markers placed outside the castle. The Unsullied are organized in three groups in the middle outside the front of the. To either side of the Unsullied are markers representing the Northerners and in front are the Dothraki. Facing towards all these troops are markers representing the Army of the Dead, these markers far outnumber the allies of Winterfell. Standing around the table (clockwise) is SANSA, JON, ARYA, SAMWELL, THEON, ALYS, BRIENNE, JAIME, BERIC, TORMUND, DAVOS, LYANNA, ROYCE, QHONO, GREY WORM, VARYS, DAENERYS, JORAH and TYRION. BRAN is seated behind JON.

JON: We can't beat them in a straight fight.

JAIME: So, what can we do?

JON: The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.

JAIME: If that's true, he'll never expose himself.

BRAN: Yes, he will.

Everyone in the room turns to look at Bran.

BRAN: He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

SAMWELL: Why? What does he want?

BRAN: An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.

SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.

TYRION: How will he find you?

BRAN: His mark is on me.

BRAN lifts the cuff of his right arm, revealing a red mark in the shape of a hand.

BRAN: He always knows where I am.

JON: We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.

BRAN: No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

The camera pans over the map of Winterfell, to the East, yet still within the walls, is the Godswood.

SANSA: You want us to use you as bait?

ARYA: We're not leaving you alone out there.

THEON: He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.

DAVOS: We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.

TYRION: When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.

DAENERYS: Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.

TYRION looks shocked and turns to her.

TYRION: Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.

DAENERYS: There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.

TYRION nods.

DAVOS: The dragons should give us an edge in the field.

JON: If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.

ARYA: Dragonfire will stop him?

BRAN: I don't know. No one's ever tried.

TORMUND: We're all going to die.

He turns to look at BRIENNE.

TORMUND: But at least we die together.

JON: Let's get some rest.

Everyone begins to leave the library as JON and DAENERYS remain at the table.

JON: Your Grace.

JON then exits along with almost everyone else. Only TYRION and BRAN remain.

TYRION: Do you need help?

BRAN: No.

TYRION: You've had a strange journey.

BRAN: Stranger than most.

TYRION: I'd like to hear about it.

TYRION grabs a wooden chair and drags it over next to BRAN.

BRAN: It's a long story.

TYRION sits in the chair.

TYRION: If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Unsullied soldiers clean their weapons as GREY WORM walks past. MISSANDEI walks into the courtyard and sees two young girls.

MISSANDEI: Hello.

The girls quickly grab one another’s hands and run off. GREY WORM stands behind her as she turns around to face him. GREY WORM walks up to her.

GREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?

MISSANDEI: Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.

GREY WORM: Then I will take you there.

MISSANDEI: My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.

GREY WORM: My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
EXT. WINTERFELL - NIGHT

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS

The camera pans up over the wall and SAMWELL and JON stand next to each other with GHOST, JON’s direwolf, behind them. SAMWELL leans over slightly towards JON.

SAMWELL: Have you told her yet?

JON: No.

SAMWELL: Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-

He pauses and they both look at each other and fall silent. EDD walks up the stair behind them and stands between them.

EDD: And now our watch begins.

JON: Gilly? Little Sam?

SAMWELL: They'll be safe down in the crypt.

JON: If you want to join them.

SAMWELL looks at him and frowns.

JON: To protect them.

SAMWELL: Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.

EDD: Thenn.

SAMWELL: I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.

EDD: Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.

SAMWELL: Well, calling you "fucked" wouldn't be strictly accurate.

SAMWELL chuckles and EDD looks at him. He turns to see JON laughing too.

EDD: Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.

SAMWELL sighs.

SAMWELL: Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.

JON: Now it's just us three.

EDD: Last man left, burn the rest of us.

The camera rises over the wall and the silhouette of the trees in the distance block the light slowly fading over the horizon.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL

The fire in the hearth of the hall is lit. Two wooden chairs sit facing it, occupied by JAIME to the left of the fire and TYRION to the right. They both sip on wine.

TYRION: I wish Father were here.

JAIME looks at TYRION in shock.

TYRION: I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.

JAIME snorts.

JAIME: That would be something to see.

TYRION: I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.

JAIME: Mm.

TYRION: You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.

JAIME: It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.

TYRION: I was speaking in relative terms.

JAIME: Do you miss it?

TYRION: Of course I miss it.

JAIME: Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.

TYRION sighs

TYRION: It's not. Things would be easier if it were.

TYRION raises his cup to toast.

TYRION: The perils of self-betterment.

JAIME raises his and they both go to drink. JAIME stops himself when the door to the hall opens and BRIENNE and PODRICK walk in. JAIME stands up quickly and they both turn to look at the visitors.

JAIME: Oh! My lady.

BRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-

TYRION: To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.

TYRION walks over to where the wine is kept, PODRICK starts to walk to him.

PODRICK: Thank you, milord.

BRIENNE: I don't think that's wise.

PODRICK turns back to BRIENNE.

BRIENNE: The battle might start at any moment.

She pauses.

BRIENNE: Half cup.

TYRION: And you?

TYRION continues to pour PODRICK’s drink until the cup overflows with wine.

BRIENNE: No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.

JAIME: You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.

JAIME places another chair in front of the fire.

BRIENNE: All right. Just a bit.

TYRION pours BRIENNE a drink and hands it to her as she sits down. PODRICK grabs a chair and brings it over and sits down. DAVOS and TORMUND enter the hall.

DAVOS: Well, what do we have here?

TYRION: Ser Davos, join us.

DAVOS: No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.

DAVOS stands in front of the fire to warm up.

DAVOS: I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.

TORMUND walks up to BRIENNE and stands in front of her.

TORMUND: It could be our last night in this world, you know.

JAIME, now sitting down next to BRIENNE, glances up.

BRIENNE: Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

She pauses and quickly tries to recover.

BRIENNE: Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.

TYRION: Would you like a drink?

TORMUND turns to TYRION and raises his drinking horn.

TORMUND: Brought my own.

TORMUND looks at JAIME, over to BRIENNE, and then back to JAIME again.

TORMUND: They call you "King Killer."

JAIME: I'm sure someone does.

TORMUND: They call me "Giantsbane." Want to know why?

JAIME sighs and looks over at TYRION who is still standing to the side of the room with his wine. TORMUND grabs a wooden chair and places it with his back to the fire so that he is facing JAIME and BRIENNE. He sits down and leans forwards.

TORMUND: I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.

DAVOS glances at TORMUND, clearly perplexed.

TORMUND: When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.

TORMUND raises the horn to his mouth and starts drinking from it whilst gulping noisily. Everyone stares at him as the drink pours out the horn, mostly down his front.

DAVOS: Maybe I will have that drink.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS

SANDOR “THE HOUND” CLEGANE sits with back against the battlements drinking alone. ARYA walks up to him and he notices her. She walks closer and SANDOR silently offers the drink. ARYA sits down next to SANDOR and takes a swig. They sit silently staring ahead.

SANDOR: You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.

ARYA: Guess I've changed.

She pauses.

ARYA: What are you doing up here?

SANDOR: What's it look like?

ARYA: No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?

SANDOR turns to her.

SANDOR: I fought for you, didn't I?

BERIC walks up to the two of them and stops in front of them.

SANDOR: Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.

BERIC smiles. He turns to look at ARYA.

BERIC: My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

SANDOR turns to ARYA.

SANDOR: Was he on your list?

ARYA: For a little while.

BERIC: That's all right.

BERIC sits down on a barrel opposite the two.

BERIC: The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-

SANDOR: Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.

He points to the wall he’s leaning against. BERIC chuckles and holds his hand out. SANDOR passes him the drink. ARYA stands up and starts walking away from them.

SANDOR: Where are you going?

ARYA turns around to look at them.

ARYA: I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.

ARYA exits and SANDOR and BERIC sit in silence.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY

A bowstring creaks as an arrow is fired. It hits its target next to two other arrows previously shot. The camera cuts to see ARYA holding a large bow in a dimly lit hallway. She lowers it and picks up another arrow. GENDRY watches from a doorway. She fires another arrow and turns as GENDRY walks up to her.

ARYA: That for me?

GENDRY raises a spear with a dragonglass head. ARYA lays down her bow and takes the spear.

ARYA: This'll work.

GENDRY: Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…

ARYA: What did the Red Woman want with you?

GENDRY: She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.

ARYA: Why your blood?

GENDRY: I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard. I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.

ARYA: Was that your first time?

GENDRY: No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.

ARYA: Your first time with a woman.

GENDRY: What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.

ARYA: Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?

GENDRY scoffs.

ARYA: Or after?

GENDRY stammers indistinctly.

ARYA: You don't remember?

GENDRY scoffs.

GENDRY: Yes, I was.

ARYA: One? Two? Twenty?

GENDRY: Well, I didn't keep count.

ARYA: Yes, you did.

GENDRY sighs.

GENDRY: Three.

ARYA pauses and walks up to him.

ARYA: We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.

GENDRY: Arya, I-

ARYA inhales sharply as she pulls GENDRY in and starts kissing him. They start undressing themselves and each other whilst still kissing. She pushes GENDRY back onto a pile of bags as she takes off her top. GENDRY, who is still just wearing his pants, notices a couple scars on ARYA’s side.

ARYA: I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.

She pulls her own pants off and climbs on top of GENDRY and starts kissing him.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL

The fire is still lit and the people who were in there earlier still sit there. Opposite the fire sits (from left to right) TORMUND, BRIENNE, JAIME, DAVOS, TYRION and PODRICK. They sit in silence before TYRION breaks it.

TYRION: It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.

BRIENNE: At least we'll die with honor.

TYRION: I think we might live.

DAVOS and PODRICK both start laughing.

TYRION: I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.

DAVOS: All without a shred of combat ability.

TYRION: Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.

JAIME: Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.

JAIME stands up to get himself another drink.

TYRION: Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

TORMUND: She's not a ser? You're not a knight?

BRIENNE: Women can't be knights.

TORMUND: Why not?

BRIENNE: Tradition.

TORMUND: Fuck tradition.

BRIENNE: I don't even want to be a knight.

PODRICK looks at her, slightly confused. BRIENNE ignores him.

TORMUND: I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you 10 times over.

JAIME: You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.

JAIME places his cup on the table where the wine is kept.

JAIME: I'll prove it.

JAIME unsheathes his sword and stands in the middle of the room and holds his sword out.

JAIME: Kneel, Lady Brienne.

BRIENNE scoffs.

JAIME: Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.

BRIENNE looks at PODRICK who nods. She stands up, walks to the middle of the room opposite JAIME and kneels before him. PODRICK and DAVOS both turn in their seats to see and TYRION and TORMUND both stand. JAIME places the sword on her right shoulder.

JAIME: In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.

He raises it over her head and places it on her left shoulder.

JAIME: In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.

He raises the sword and places it on her right shoulder again.

JAIME: In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.

He lowers the sword to his side.

JAIME: Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

BRIENNE smiles as she stands up and the rest of the room all applaud.

TYRION: Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

BRIENNE smiles ecstatically.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS

SAMWELL is walking down the stairs from the battlements

JORAH (O.S.): We have all we need to win this war.

LYANNA (O.S.): I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again.

JORAH (O.S.): Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house.

SAMWELL notices the two talking down in the courtyard and starts to walk towards them.

LYANNA: I don't need you to remind me of that.

JORAH: You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

We now see JORAH and LYANNA up close.

LYANNA: I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.

LYANNA turns around to see SAMWELL facing them both

SAMWELL: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

LYANN: It's all right. We're done here.

LYANNA starts to walk off but stops and turns back to JORAH.

LYANNA: I wish you good fortune, cousin.

JORAH: Thank you, my lady.

LYANNA exits and SAMWELL walks closer to JORAH.

JORAH: What have you got there?

SAMWELL raises his sword.

SAMWELL: It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.

JORAH: You still have a family.

SAMWELL: Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.

He hands JORAH the sword and JORAH removes it from its sheath slightly to examine it.

JORAH: I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.

SAMWELL: I'll see you when it's through.

SAMWELL walks off but stops several feet away and turns back to JORAH.

SAMWELL: I hope we win.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL

Everyone sits around the fire still but DAVOS is standing next to where the wine is.

JAIME: We'd better get some rest.

TYRION: No, let's stay a bit longer.

DAVOS: We're out of wine.

DAVOS sits back down.

TYRION: How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?

DAVOS: You'll pray for a quick death.

TYRION chuckles.

TYRION: Ser Brienne?

BRIENNE shakes her head. TYRION turns to TORMUND who shakes his head too.

TORMUND: Mm-mm.

TYRION: Mmm.

PODRICK starts singing “Jenny of Oldstones”.

PODRICK: High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – SAMWELL’S QUARTERS

As PODRICK continues to sing, SAMWELL and GILLY lay in bed with LITTLE SAME between them.

PODRICK (V.O.): The ones who'd been gone for so very long.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

The camera pans down to show SANSA and THEON sitting opposite each other. PODRICK's singing continues.

PODRICK (V.O.): She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY

The camera pans and we see GENDRY sleeping on the pile of bags and ARYA lays next to him with her eyes open. PODRICK’s singing continues.

PODRICK (V.O.): Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

The Unsullied start walking out of the courtyard as MISSANDEI and GREY WORM walk together before he stops her, turns to her, and kisses her. He then turns to leave with the Unsullied and MISSANDEI watches as he leaves. PODRICK’s singing continues.

PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE

Everyone gathers outside the castle as they prepare for battle. JORAH rides on his horse and gazes at the horizon to see only darkness. PODRICK’s singing continues.

PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
INT. WINTERFELL - NIGHT

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS

DAENERYS turns a corner as she sees JON staring at a statute of his biological mother, LYANNA STARK. She walks up to him. He glances at her and smiles as she walks closer. She holds his arm as they both look at the statute together.

DAENERYS: Who's that?

JON: Lyanna Stark.

DAENERYS looks troubled.

DAENERYS: My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.

JON: He didn't. He loved her.

JON turns to face DAENERYS.

JON: They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.

DAENERYS starts to look at him, slightly concerned.

JON: My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.

DAENERYS exhales sharply as she pulls away.

DAENERYS: That's impossible.

JON: I wish it were.

DAENERYS: Who told you this?

JON: Bran. He saw it.

DAENERYS: He saw it?

JON: And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.

DAENERYS: A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?

JON: It's true, Dany. I know it is.

DAENERYS: If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

Suddenly a horn blares and JON turns around.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS

JON and DAENERYS walk behind the battlements and stand next to TYRION as the three stare out over the wall.

MAN: Form up! Get yourselves back!

JON nods at DAENERYS and they both quickly exit. TYRION watches but turns his attention back over the wall. The camera pans away.

CUT TO: PATH TO WINTERFELL

In an icy haze, the mangled legs of a dead horse trot forward before stopping. The camera pans up to show a white walker sitting upon the dead horse and the entire army of white walkers standing in a line upon their horses is slowly revealed. The camera pans around their backs before settling on the faint glow of Winterfell in the distance.
CREDITS

INT: Winterfell passageway, night

SAM shivers and rubs his hands as the wind whistles.

NORTHMAN 1: Oi!

The northman surprises SAM by forcing the hilt of a dragonglass sword in SAM's open hands. An armored soldier pushes by. SAM is overwhelmed and anxious.

NORTHMAN 2: Mind out.

NORTHMAN 1: MOVE!

SAM, still shivering, walks through the dark passageway, passing many northern soldiers. He emerges in the courtyard, which is full of activity in spite of the darkness. Men chatter as they prepare. SAM stops short, cut off by Unsullied warriors, marching double time.

NORTHMAN: Look, on the west wall!

SOLDIER: Get down to the crypt!

A baby cries somewhere in the courtyard. SAM looks, then nervously changes direction.

SOLDIER: Just hold.

MAN: We'll take him.

LYANNA MORMONT appears behind him, directing her men.

LYANNA: Come on, help the lads!

SOLDIER 1: Yes, my lady.

LYANNA: Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position.

SOLDIER 1: Come on.

SOLDIER 2: Close the gate!

SAM walks past TYRION, then exits.

SOLDIER 3: That's it.

TYRION walks somberly through the busy courtyard. He picks up a bag and slings it over his shoulder. BRAN rolls by, pushed by THEON and accompanied by ALYS KARSTARK and some northern soldiers. They walk through the courtyard on their way to the godswood.

CUT TO: The ramparts

Warmed by their fires, men stand in anticipation, eyes scanning the darkness. DAVOS delivers a bucket of arrows. SANSA and ARYA stare into the darkness. SANSA looks worried. Her eyes turn upwards in response to Drogon's screech. Drogon and Rhaegal fly overhead.

CUT TO: Outside the walls

A company of Unsullied warriors double march to join the formation. The entire Unsullied company stands at attention in disciplined rows and columns. Ahead of them stands a line of catapults, with stones and braziers by their side. In front of the siege weapons, the entire Dothraki horde is mounted and waiting, swords drawn.

The northmen also stand at the ready, fronted by JAIME and BRIENNE. GREY WORM stands in command of the Unsullied. TORMUND and BERIC helm the motley wilding force. The HOUND and GENDRY push thier way to the front to join them and EDDISON TOLLETT. A nervous SAM arrives. jostling EDDISON.

EDDISON: Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time.

Horses snort and whinny. A mounted JORAH waits, seasoned and determined. Ghost stands nearby. The wind blows and the darkness reveals nothing.

CUT TO: A nearby mountaintop.

JON walks by Drogon and Rhaegal. They growl. He joins DAENERYS to survey the great army that waits before Winterfell. The moon shines through the clouds above.

CUT TO: The ramparts

ARYA and SANSA look out. The wind whistles. A lone rider approaches slowly amidst the darkness, catching the eye of DAVOS. He strains to see.

CUT TO: Outside the walls

The rider is MELISANDRE. She silently leads her mount to stop in front of JORAH. She looks at the Dothraki.

MELISANDRE: Do you speak their tongue?

JORAH: (Nods.)

MELISANDRE: Tell them to lift their swords.

JORAH and MELISANDRE take measure of one another. Then JORAH turns to the mounted horde.

JORAH: (speaks in Dothraki)

The Dothraki respond by raising their weapons. JORAH returns his apprehensive gaze to MELISANDRE. She nudges her horse forward and stops next to QHONO, the nearest Dothraki. She clasps his curved weapon in her left hand, her index finger pressed against the cutting edge. She concentrates as she offers an incantation.

MELISANDRE: (speaks in Valyrian)

The blade she holds ignites in flame. Quickly, the other raised weapons blaze with flame as well, surprising the Dothraki who hold them. They yell in celebration of the magic.

CUT TO: The ramparts

ARYA and SANSA look on in amazement. The flames travel in a wave through the entire Dothraki force, lighting up the night. DAVOS watches, cautiously.

CUT TO: Outside the walls

BRIENNE, GREY WORM, TORMUND, BERIC, SAM and EDDISON marvel at the sea of fire and the cheers of the Dothraki.

JORAH nods in approval to MELISANDRE. She rides quietly past the Dothraki force, JORAH turns his mount and draws Heartsbane with renewed vigor. MELISANDRE reaches the last of the Dothraki and turns to ride in front of the Dothraki. She passes by GREY WORM.

MELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.

GREY WORM: Valar dohaeris.

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS watches as MELISANDRE turns again and heads towards the gates of Winterfell. He is not pleased to see her again.

DAVOS: Open the gate!

SOLDIER 1: Open the gate!

ARYA and SANSA look over to DAVOS.

SOLDIER 2: Open the gate!

CUT TO: The gate of Winterfell

Four soldiers lift the great beam that secures the gate. The doors open and MELISANDRE rides in.

CUT TO: The Ramparts

DAVOS descends the stairs to intercept MELISANDRE.

CUT TO: The gate of Winterfell MELISANDRE has dismounted and a northern MAN sees to her horse.

MAN: Come. Come on. Easy.

MELISANDRE walks through the courtyard.

CUT TO: Walkway

DAVOS and MELISANDRE meet at a raised walkway. She lowers her hood and approaches while DAVOS stares.

MELISANDRE: There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn.

DAVOS gives way as MELISANDRE walks past. She pauses, half way up the stairs, where she can see ARYA atop the ramparts. In the distance, a soldier yells and the Dothraki ululate. MELISANDRE walks on.

CUT TO: Atop the ramparts

ARYA rejoins SANSA as the mounted Dothraki, spur their horses forward into a charge, yelling wildly. ARYA and SANSA exchange a look.

CUT TO: The Dothraki

The Dothraki horde gallops and ululates. JORAH rides among them.

CUT TO: A nearby mountaintop.

DAENERYS and JON watch the wild charge. The flaming swords all them to see the full shape of the onslaught as the the Dothraki pull far away from the rest of the forces.

CUT TO: Outside the walls

Northern soldiers light the stones on the the catapults and trebuchets. They arc like meteors over the heads of the charging Dothraki.

CUT TO: The Dothraki

JORAH and Ghost gallop among the Dothraki. The flaming stones crash to earth in front of them. The snarls of the undead army precede them. Suddenly the two armies are upon one another, the ferocious undead emerging from the darkness, massive in size and in numbers. Some Dothraki are surprised by their sudden confrontation with ghoulish giants.

CUT TO: A nearby mountaintop.

DAENERYS and JON watch the flames of the Dothraki swarm around their darkened foes. Burning stones continue to rain down, landing just beyond the mounted fighters. DAENERYS's eyes are wide in

CUT TO: Outside the walls

BRIENNE and JAIME watch from afar. They exchange a look. The lights of the ignited swords dance in battle.

SOLDIER: (in Dothraki) Cease fire!

Slowly the lights dwindle until most are extinguished. The distance sound of battle gives way to the whistling wind. GREY WORM, the HOUND and BERIC look on. The lights become sparser still. JAIME squints to make out the movements in the dark. Then the last of the fires disappear. SAM and EDDISON exhcange a worried look while GENDRY scans the horizon. An eerie quiet takes hold, save for the sound of the wind. TORMUND ponders.

CUT TO: Atop the ramparts

ARYA and SANSA watch silently.

Cut TO: Outside the walls

The wind carries the sound of a few hoofbeats. GREY WORM listens. A single, riderless horse neighs as it gallops out the darkness towards Winterfell. ALYS KARSTARK watches for more signs of the Dothraki. GENDRY looks about, nervous.

A horse whinnies in the darkness, followed by more neighing. Riderless horses trickle back towards Winterfell. SAM is forlorn. Some Dothraki men run past, retreating on foot, followed by more horses. JORAH rides from the darkness along with some Dothraki. TORMUND looks carefully at JORAH for more information. JORAH is exhausted and hopeless, eyes unfocussed.

CUT TO: A nearby mountaintop.

DAENERYS is shocked and horrified. She turns to find her dragons and help her people. JON grabs her arm and stops her, reminder her of the plan.

JON: The Night King is coming.

DAENERYS shrugs off his grip. She fumes as she looks JON in the eye.

DAENERYS: The dead are already here.

DAENERYS walks back to mount Drogon. The dragon roars.

CUT TO: Outside the walls.

The northern army looks worried. SAM and EDDARD listen to the whistling wind. The HOUND is edgy. TORMUND and BERIC stand tense and ready. GENDRY grips his sword. PODRICK takes a breath.

In front of the Unsullied, GREY WORM's face twists in anger. He puts on his helmet. The wind blows stronger. A soft patter becomes a rumble of running feet as the undead army starts to boil forth the darkness, running at full tilt. Once visible, they come in like a tidal wave.

GREY WORM: (speaks in Valyrian)

The Unsullied take their braced battle stance, spears pointed forward. The army of wights crashes over them, shrieking and snarling. They stab and slice the Unsullied as they barrel through. TORMUND and the HOUND, stand just off to the side with the northmen. They marvel at the sheer force and number of the undead. Then undead wave reaches them as well.

TORMUND: (yells)

JAIME, BRIENNE and their company brace for the coming onslaught.

BRIENNE: Stand your ground!

The undead crash into their cadre at full speed and the battle is joined. JAIME fights. BERIC's swings his flaming sword. The undead land gruesome blows to the northmen. BRIENNE is knocked of her feet by a speeding wight and is trapped in a crowd of the undead. JAIME notices her plight and leaps to help. He pieces the wight that has tackled BRIENNE and throws him aside. Just ten, The dragons above shoot forth a wall of flame as they dive past, disintegrating a swath of weights. JAIME looks up at the dragons.

CUT TO: Above the battle

DAENERYS and Drogon ascend as the inferno below them burns. DAENERYS surveys the battle from above as she looks for her next line of attack.

CUT TO: The battle

The rush of wights continues. TORMUND dispatches some of the ghouls. Behind him, Drogon and Rhaegal lay down crossing walls of fire.

CUT TO: Above the battle

JON rides Rhaegal above the devastation they have unleashed, taking stock of the battle

CUT TO: The battle

SAM, illuminated by flames nearby looks up at the dragons

CUT TO: The ramparts

Rhaegal banks past ARYA and SANSA. Further away, Drogon spews forth an arc of flame. Rhaegal joins in. ARYA and SANSA take in the power of the dragons, and the enormity of the undead army.

CUT TO: Above the battle

JON and DAENERYS fly side-by-side, away from Winterfell. When the plain meets the woods, JON sees the mounted White Walkers. He and DAENERYS exchange a look, and then dive towards their enemy. The white walkers notice the approaching dragons. Suddenly, a ferocious gale of blowing snow rolls out from the woods, enveloping JON and DAENERYS. JON loses his bearings and fight to remain aloft. DAENERYS rips through the undead below with Drogon's firebreath, then struggles against the great storm.

CUT TO: The ramparts.

ARYA and SANSA do not like the way the battle is going.

ARYA: Get down to the crypt.

SANSA: I'm not abandoning my people.

ARYA: Take this and go.

ARYA extends the hilt of a dragonstone dagger. SANSA accepts it, tentatively.

SANSA: I don't know how to use it.

ARYA: Stick them with the pointy end.

SANSA exits, and ARYA turns to face the battle. She takes her bow from her back.

CUT TO: The battle

JAIME grunts as he dispatches another weight. Behind him, PODRICK and TORMUND fight their own foes. The arctic blast from the woods reaches them, and visibility worsens. TORMUND looks up as DROGON and DAENERYS spew forth another fire line of devastation.

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON stands by BRAN, his bow strapped around his back. The roiling snow blast reaches them and their company, and creates a white out.

CUT TO: The battle

JORAH rides through the ongoing fight, Dismembering a wight with one great swing, then another. His face is bloodied and he looks exhausted. As he pivots his mount, a wight tackles him from behind, and he and is horse both fall. He rolls to his feet and continues to battle. Nearby, BRIENNE grunts as she cuts through her assailants. She tries to catch her breath, but a wight attacks before she can. TORMUND's berserk attacks are brutal and effective, but he is also out of breath. JAIME is more deft in his parries and footwork. PODRICK pushes away the wight that tries to take him down. GENDRY and the HOUND also fight in the fray.

A wight leaps through the air and wraps himself around JAIME. The Kingslayer tries to shake him off. Another wight tackles TORMUND. SAM shouts and slays an undead fighter. EDDISON circles behind him, but is taken down be a leaping wight.

SAMWELL: Edd! Edd!

Another wight tackles SAM before he can help his friend, pinning him to the ground on his back. SAM fights with all he has to stop the the undead's blade from forcing into his skull. EDDISON saves SAM by stabbing the wight through the back. SAM whimpers, and his sense slow as exhaustion takes over.

EDDISON: Sam, get up!

EDDISON grabs SAM's shirt and pulls him to his feet. As SAM regains his strength, EDDISON is stabbed from behind. Blood spews from his mouth as he gasps and staggers.

EDDISON: Oh, God. Sam.

EDDISON collapses. SAM looks at the snarling wight behind EDDISON. SAM turns and flees.

WOMAN: Edd!

CUT TO: The crypt

SANSA walks down the steps to the crypt. Above her, the heavy door closes and is locked by a guard. She joins the crowd of women, children and elderly who are huddling in the crypt, along with TYRION, VARYS, GILLY and LITTLE SAM. SANSA takes stock, and locks eyes with MISSANDEI. Finally, she and TYRION exchange a look. TYRION takes a large gulp from his wineskin and walks away.

CUT TO: Above the battle

The wind howls. The clouds of snow hang in the air. Rhaegal flies through. JON holds on to the powerful dragon as they crash through snow-covered treetops. Rhaegal regains control of his flight. JON gasps for breath. He looks behind him at the peril they escaped. Suddenly, Drogon appears from the snow cloud in front of them, on a collision course. The dragons bank to avoid one another. DAENERYS grunts as she is nearly thrown from Drogon. JON strains to check that DAENERYS is safe as the dragons pull side by side. The dragons struggle to fly against the wind and snow, and JON and DAENERYS are constantly tested by the unpredictable and jerky flight. Once they have settled, DAENERYS looks down through the blowing snow to take in the battle. The undead army continues to surge forward with inhuman stamina.

CUT TO: The battle.

TORMUND grunts as he lands each blow.

TORMUND: Fall back! Fall back!

A wight stumbles as it tries to attack TORMUND from behind. He raises his weapon and delivers a powerful overhead strike.

BRIENNE: Fall back!

The northmen follow the command to retreat.

SOLDIER: Come on!

CUT TO: Winterfell Courtyard

LYANNA stands with her soldiers.

LYANNA: Open the gate!

SOLDIER 1: Open the gate!

Her men run to the gate.

SOLDIER 2: Let us in!

SOLDIER 1: Open the gate!

SOLDIER 3: Open the gate!

Four soldiers remove the crossbeam and open the mighty gate. The injured and weary northern army rushes in noisily.

SOLDIER 4: Keep moving!

SOLDIER 5: Come on!

LYANNA: Keep moving, fast.

SOLDIER 5: To your posts.

SOLDIER 6: Go!

SOLDIER 7: Keep moving!

SOLDIER 1: Come on, run! Keep moving!

CUT TO: Outside the gate

GREY WORM watches as the northmen retreat through the gate. The undead battle with the Unsullied nearby.

GREY WORM: (in Valyrian) Protect the retreat!

The Unsullied fend of the ferocious attacks for the undead.

GREY WORM: (in Valyrian) Stand your ground!

As one, the Unsullied take a defensive stance, spears pointed forward. The undead swarm into them with great force. The Unsullied slow the progress of the undead.

CUT TO: Winterfell Gate

Men continue to pour through the gate. Just beyond, the northmen fall back behind battalions of the Unsullied, who stand at attention. Sounds of the battle beyond ring through the blasts of wind and snow.

CUT TO: Above the battle

JON and DAENERYS fight to fly against the storm.

JON: Dany!

DAENERYS cannot hear him. JON guides Rhaegal to bank to the right.

CUT TO: The godswood.

BRAN sits pensively. Above, he can see Rhaegal fighting to hover before the dragon lands heavily on the wall surrounding the godswood. JON looks around.

CUT TO: The courtyard

Soldiers rush towards the gate.

SOLDIER 1: Grab your weapon now!

SOLDIER 2: Guard the barricades!

SOLDIER 3: Through that pass!

LYANNA watches the men rushing through. Near the gate, BRIENNE tries to maintain some control of the rushing crowd.

BRIENNE: Hey! Hey! Hey!

SOLDIER 4: Close up the gaps!

BRIENNE: Go! Hey! Go! Go!

BRIENNE ushers PODRICK into the courtyard. Nearby, JAIME takes command of those near him.

JAIME: Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!

CUT TO: Outside the gate

Men run towards the gate. Beyond the wooden fortifications, the Unsullied stand their ground.

GREY WORM: (shouts in Valyrian)

The Unsullied grunt as one in response to the command. The undead continue their onslaught, but the Unsullied stop them.

CUT TO: Above the battle

Northerns flee in great numbers to the gate. There are only a handful of lines of Unsullied remaining. The endless waves of undead continue. The Unsullied are near then end of their defensive effort.

CUT TO: Outside the gate

Soldiers run as fast as they can towards the gate. Flaming arrows shoot through the air above them.

SOLDIER 1: Move!

TORMUND takes down a wight with a mighty blow. The man beside him does the same, but is felled by an arrow right after. The snarling undead wrestle through the wooden palisades. ARYA takes careful aim and shoots a flaming arrow, felling the wight pursuing the HOUND. He turns around in surprise, looks up to ARYA, then back at the felled creature. He swings his axe anew.

CUT TO: The Unsullied

The Unsullied begin to fall back.

SOLDIER 1: (in Valyrian) Retreat!

SOLDIER 2: (in Valyrian) Retreat!

SOLDIER 1: Come on!

LYANNA: Protect the gate!

SOLDIER 1: Protect the gate!

JAIME: They're coming! Come on!

HOUND: Fall back!

CUT TO: The Unsullied

GREY WORM runs forward to take stock of the battle. Panting, he watches the undead making slow but constant progress against the last lines of the Unsullied.

GREY WORM: Light the trench! Light the trench!

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS picks up two torches and waves them to signal GREY WORM's command.

SOLDIER 2: Wait!

SOLDIER 3: Light the trench!

CUT TO: The Unsullied

GREY WORM continues to pant as he watches the ferocious undead army battle against the Unsullied and the northmen in front of him. Deciding that it is time, he grabs a rope and pulls with all his might. This triggers the collapse of the wood that spans the trench in front of him. A fury of arrows descends from the ramparts behind him.

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS continues to signal with his torches.

CUT TO: Above the battle

DAENERYS and Drogon fly through the turbulent clouds of snow

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS lowers his torches.

DAVOS: She can't see us.

DAVOS throws down the torches in frustration.

DAVOS: Light the trenches!

Archers shoot flaming torches at the palisade in the trenches. The harsh wind blows out the flames before the stakes catch fire.

CUT TO: The battlefield

The seemingly endless undead army continues to surge forward, snarling and growling.

CUT TO: Outside the gates

GREY WORM pants from exhaustion, and removes his helmet.

SOLDIER 1: With a torch, light the trenches! Right there.

SOLDIER 2: Torch it!

The soldiers grab torches from the braziers

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS: Light the trenches!

CUT TO: Outside the gates

The soldiers run from the brazier to towards the trenches. One by one, they tackled by wights before they reach their objective. GREY WORM assesses the battle, and locks eyes with MELISANDRE through the mist.

JORAH, BERIC, TORMUND and the HOUND protect the gate. Snarling wights try to force their way through the palisades.

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS looks down to the gate as a battalion of Unsullied march out.

CUT TO: Outside the gates

JORAH, BERIC, TORMUND and the HOUND give way to the Unsullied, who march double time into a defensive formation. They align their shields to form a barrier, then take a battle stance. MELISANDRE emerges from the gate. The HOUND slays a wight nearby. The Unsullied captain gives a command, and the soldiers stand at attention, creating an aisle for MELISANDRE. She walks to the trench and places her hand on a frozen log, eyes closed.

MELISANDRE: (chants in Valyrian)

JORAH and some Unsullied fight back the charging undead. Flaming arrows streak down from the ramparts into the darkness beyond the trench. The growls of the undead creep out of the darkness.

MELISANDRE: (urgently chants in Valyrian)

The HOUND, BERIC and TORMUND stand their ground, helping to protect MELISANDRE. The wights get dangerously close to MELISANDRE, who opens her eyes at the threat.

MELISANDRE: (depserately chants in Valyrian)

A wight leaps over the trench to grapple MELISANDRE. Just in time, sparks explode between her hands and the log. The oil in the trench quickly ignites, consuming the attacking ghoul and those behind it. The trench erupts into a blinding wall of flame, stopping the swarm of undead attackers. They shriek in surprise and pain. For now, Winterfell is protected from the charge.

CUT TO: Above the battle

The glow of the flaming trench reaches DAENERYS and JON, who fly high above.

CUT TO: Outside the gate

The fiery wall leaps twenty feet into the air. The flames light up the wall of Winterfell. MELISANDRE looks on her inferno with relief.

CUT TO: The ramparts

ARYA and DAVOS watch as DAENERYS directs Drogon to incinerate a swath of undead beyond the flaming trench.

CUT TO: The trench

Some wights squirm and crawl out of the trench, engulfed in flames. Unsullied warriors march past JORAH, BERIC and the HOUND, who fight to catch their breath. Beyond the wall of flame, the undead stand, motionless and staring. The HOUND walks away.

BERIC: Clegane.

CUT TO: The crypt

A baby cries, but otherwise those gathered in the crypt are quiet.

WOMAN: You must try not to worry yourself.

SANSA, VARYS and MISSANDEI sit apart from the others. The residents of Winterfell wait with concern on their faces. GILLY looks at TYRION, who is facing the other way.

VARYS: (Sighs.) At least we're already in a crypt.

TYRION: If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.

VARYS: (Scoffs.)

TYRION: What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.

VARYS: And got your face cut in half.

TYRION: And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...

SANSA: You'd die. There's nothing you can do.

TYRION picks up a stool and places it next to SANSA.

TYRION: You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.

TYRION drinks from his wine skin.

SANSA: Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.

TYRION: Maybe we should have stayed married.

SANSA: You were the best of them.

TYRION: What a terrifying thought.

SANSA: It wouldn't work between us.

TYRION: Why not?

SANSA: The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.

MISSANDEI: Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already.

MISSANDEI stands and walks away. TYRION and SANSA exchange a look.

CUT TO: The godswood

The wild whips through the godswood. THEON continues to guard BRAN, bow strapped to his back.

THEON: They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did

BRAN: Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.

THEON weighs BRAN's words.

BRAN: I'm going to go now.

THEON: Go where?

BRAN's eyes go white.

CUT TO: A tree beyond the battlefield

A raven's eyes go white as BRAN wargs into the bird. The ravens caw as they take flight from the tree, towards the fire wall. Drogon spits forth a blaze of fire into the undead army, just in front of the formation of crows. They fly past the battle, beyond WInterfell, and the high into the dark sky. They hear the slow flaps of a great dragon, then come upon the NIGHT KING riding Viserion. The NIGHT KING extends his hand in command, which crackles like freezing water.

CUT TO: The trench.

The undead army stands motionless behind the flaming trench. One wight steps calmly forward into the trench, falling forward. Then another joins him, and another still. They pile on top of one another at a quickening pace.

CUT TO: The ramparts

DAVOS watches as the undead sacrifice themselves, one by one. He realizes that they are forming a bridge of corpses. Other groups of undead tumble into the trench, building other pathways with their bodies. ARYA and DAVOS watch silently. Dutifully, the wights fall like dominoes until they have spanned the trench.

DAVOS: Man the walls!

CUT TO: The trench

SOLDIER 1: Man the walls!

The first wave of undead forge across the corpse bridge.

CUT TO: Winterfell courtyard

SOLDIER 2: Man the wall!

LYANNA: Man the walls! Come on!

Soldiers hustle to obey the command. JAIME looks up, then moves to action. JORAH grabs SAM and drags him towards the battle.

LYANNA: Get out there! Get moving!

JAIME: Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!

BRIENNE: Come on!

CUT TO: The ramparts

Soldiers fire arrows at the approaching ghouls.

CUT TO: The trench

The undead pour across the corpse bridges and set upon the walls.

CUT TO: Above the battle

Riding Rhaegal, JON watches the onslaught as the undead army restarts their siege. Hearing flapping above, he looks upwards and sees the zombie Viserion hovering, with the NIGHT KING astride him. Viserion lets out a shriek. JON spurs Rhaegal and they fly.

CUT TO: Outside the wall

The undead reach the exterior wall of Winterfell and press themselves against in, en masse. Flaming arrows zip down from the ramparts.

SOLDIER 1: They're against the wall!

CUT TO: The courtyard

SOLDIER 1: Get more men up here!

BRIENE sprints through the yard. JAIME runs up the stairs to the ramparts, ushering soldiers to take position.

SOLDIER 1: Fill the gaps, quickly!

JAIME: Get in there!

SOLDIER 2: They're climbing the walls!

JAIME: Relieve the archers!

SOLDIER 2: Relieve the archers!

The soldiers and archers jostle and trade places.

JAIME: Archers on top!

SOLDIER 1: Move up!

JORAH ascends the stairs, two at a time. SAM follows.

SOLDIER 2: Go, go! Come here! Come on!

SOLDIER 3: Move back!

SOLDIER 4: Stand away!

SOLDIER 2: Go on, go on.

JORAH helps to shepherd the transitions.

JORAH: Go! Go.

SOLDIER 3: Step back.

SOLDIER 4: All the way, archers!

GREY WORM reaches the ramparts and puts on his helmet.

GREY WORM: (speaks in Valyrian)

JORAH looks down at the undead horde. They are piling on top of one another, creating a ramp for others to ascend to the top of the wall. They snarl and scramble with relentless energy. JAIME looks down at them.

SOLDIER 1: Hold the wall!

SOLDIER 2: The wall, they're coming up!

SOLDIER 3: Hold the wall!

SOLDIER 4: Hold the wall!

JORAH, TORMUND and GENDRY stand ready to meet the wights when they crest the wall.

JAIME: Draw!

GENDRY takes deep breaths as he looks down, wide eyed, at the relentless ghouls. The undead climb and strain. They are approaching the top of the wall. The highest wight grabs a chain, and pulls himself over the wall. GENDRY cleave him in two with a mighty swing. JAIME stabs another the face, and it topples away with a high pitched shriek.

JAIME: Come on!

Soldiers grunt as they slay the cresting wights, one by one. SAM, BRIENNE, TORMUND and GREY WORM defend their perches. A wight successfully leaps onto the rampart and tackles a soldier. JAIME dispatches him with a left-handed swing. The undead start to overwhelm the defense, crawling their way onto the rampart. JAIME does his best to battle them back. One soldier gets pulls over the wall, and tumbles into the undead mass below.

CUT TO: The wall

Still more wights are pouring across the flaming trench. There is no end in sight. The northmen fight on, shooting arrows and swinging their swords. The undead hiss and growl and they crawl over one another with unflagging battle lust.

CUT TO: The rampart

JORAH slices a climbing wight. He hears a yell above him and looks up.

SOLDIER: They're coming up!

JAIME grapples with two wights, while BRIENNE goes on a mighty charge across the rampart, sending bodies, beams and snow tumbling to the courtyard below. JAIME is pinned by two wights. BRIENNE finally reaches him, and liberates him from his captors. They fight side by side.

JAIME: Look out!

JAIME slays a ghoul attacking BRIENNE from behind. JORAH takes down another cresting the wall. SAM fights for breath, recovering from the ferocious battle. A growl makes him look up, just in time to see the wight that leaps down onto him. They struggle, and another wight joins in. JORAH appears and delivers a mighty overhead chop that saves SAM. Just beyond, the undead break through the wooden rail as they leap down into the courtyard below.

The battle commences in the courtyard as the undead pour down from above. The undead overwhelm the first northern soldiers that they encounter. Some ghouls mindlessly impale themselves on the stakes of the defensive palisades. Soldiers in the courtyard fight back while archers above unleash flaming arrows into the courtyard. BERIC joins the fray, flaming sword in hand. Undead pour into the courtyard faster than the northern soldiers can dispatch them.

CUT TO: A corner of the courtyard

The HOUND hides in a corner, shuddering. His fear of fire has overwhelmed him. The ghouls and northerners slash and hack, grapple and tumble.

CUT TO: The parapet ARYA uses her spear to slice the head off of a wight as it crests the wall. She runs down the walkway and slashes another ghoul. She expertly counters and gores a few more, then splits her spear in two, giving her a weapon in each hand. She fights her way up a stairway, dispatching wights with martial skill.

CUT TO: The courtyard

BERIC fights on, and notices the HOUND shuddering in the corner.

BERIC: Clegane! Clegane!

The HOUND hyperventilates in his trance-like state.

CUT TO: The parapet

ARYA continues her assault, and meets up with DAVOS. She spins, strikes, blocks and kicks, destroying wights left and right. She looks back at DAVOS, who marvels at her skill.

CUT TO: Outside the walls

Arrow rain down as more ghouls rush the wall.

CUT TO: The courtyard

Wights leap into the yard, tackling northerners. As LYANNA takes stock the the battle, a wooden gate behind her explodes into shards. An undead giant stand backlit by the flaming trench. It charges LYANNA and bats her away. She lets out a sharp scream.

CUT TO: The parapet

A horde of undead blocks the stairway below ARYA. With no other recourse, she leaps, tumbling on top of the undead before taking a hard landing below them. She dodges the attack of a ghoul and scurries away on all fours. As she tries to exit the stairwell, she is pushed into the wall, hitting her head. Momentarily dazed, she regains her feet as the undead attack.

CUT TO: The courtyard

The undead giant swings its mighty club back and forth, sending soldiers flying across the courtyard. Some land on the palisades, impaled on impact. cradling her stomach, LYANNA struggles to find her feet. The undead giant unleashes a devastating blow that sends a clutch of men flying through the air.

CUT TO: Another part of the courtyard.

The HOUND remains frozen and panting.

BERIC: Clegane! Clegane, we need you!

BERIC steps over to the HOUND.

BERIC: You can't give up on us.

HOUND: Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death.

Above them, ARYA leaps from the parapet onto the roof of a courtyard building. She rolls out of reach of a leaping ghoul, who bounces down the roof and into the courtyard below.

BERIC: Tell her that.

The HOUND looks up at ARYA, who scurries across the roof away from the growling wights. The HOUND sparks to action

CUT TO: The courtyard

LYANNA finds her feet, panting and in great pain. Her face is streaked with blood. She lets out a battle cry and charges the giant, wielding her war axe. The giant turns to meet her assault. He reaches down and grabs her by the chest, His vice-like grip chokes the breath from LYANNA. He squeezes harder and her ribs crack. He raises LYANNA up to his face, taunting her as he crushes the life from her. Blood pours from her mouth as she pants for breath. The one-eyed giant growls at her and draws her closer. LYANNA yells, and frees an arm to stabs the undead giant in his good eye with her dagger, Her strength leaves her, but the giant crumbles to the ground, shattering into broken shards and blocks. The undead pour through the broken gate.

CUT TO: The skies above

Above them the NIGHT KING flies on Viserion through the swirling clouds. The undead dragon roars. DAENERYS and Drogon are in pursuit followed by JON and Rhaegal. The clouds of snow and gusting winds impede the pursuit.

DAENERYS and JON fly higher, breaking the clouds to find the moon's illumination. Their dragons hover. DAENERYS and JON scan the skies for a sign of the NIGHT KING. An eruption of blue flame bursts from the clouds below JON. JON and Rhaegal veer away as the NIGHT KING and Viserion fly fly directly upwards, belching blue flame at DAENERYS and Drogon, who try to speed upwards and away. DAENERYS strains against the blue conflagration threatens to swallow them.

Meanwhile, JON and Rhaegal tailspin out of control. They fight to regain control of their path. Viserion unleashes another blue blast. Drogon weaves an evasive path while DAENERYS holds on for dear life. Then the NIGHT KING and Viserion turn away and rock back towards the earth. JON and Rhaegal finally stem their downward spiral. They come to a hover next to DAENERYS and Drogon, and look anew for signs of the NIGHT KING. JON and DAENERYS exchange a glance, then direct their dragons to dive back into the clouds beneath them.

CUT TO: Winterfell passageway

The injured ARYA secrets her way through a quiet passageway. She opens a heavy door and enters a darkened library. She pauses to catch her breath. She hears footsteps and a figure passes just beyond her, knocking into a pile of books. Another undead man enters, his sword dragging as he walks. The frightened ARYA moves from shelf to shelf, keeping out of sight of the wights that shamble in the aisles. She makes her way past half a dozen shelves before encountering a ghoul walking down the aisle toward her. She circles back. and pivots into an aisle to avoid another wight, pressing herself against the shelf. Yet another wight walks past on the other end of the aisle. ARYA quickly scampers across the open part of the room.

Now on her hands and knees, blood droplets fall from her facial wounds. A wight seems to sense her, either from the sound of the droplets or the smell of the blood. ARYA can see the door that leads to safety. But a wight steps out of the aisle just in front of her. It crouches to the ground, looking for her with its blank eyes. But she is gone, pressed against a nearby bookshelf. ARYA picks up a book and tosses it down the aisle as a decoy. The wights snarl and take the bait, swarming to where the book landed. ARYA walks quietly behind them towards the door. She rounds a shelf and comes face-to-face with a she-wight. ARYA slips her dragon glass blade beneath the wight's chin, then removes it. The she-wight collapses onto her shoulder, thick black blood pouring from its chin and mouth. ARYA quietly lowers her to the ground, then walks out the door. Once on the other side, she silently uses her body weight to close it behind her.

Her relief is interrupted by the growl of a nearby wight in the hallway. She cautiously takes some steps backward, trying to locate the undead creature. The volume rises as more creatures approach. Suddenly, a door behind her breaks apart, and wights start pouring into the darkened hallway. ARYA sprints away, pursued by some ferocious wights. Panting, ARYA bumbles through the dark twists of the passageway, and begins to run. The ghouls pursue and close the gap between them. Gasping for breath, ARYA runs full tilt into a darkened passage.

CUT TO: The crypt

Distant snarls echo through the crypt. The women and children look around, nervously. VARYS looks at the stairwell leading to the crypt as the snarling sounds echo down. TYRION takes a drink from his wine skin. A sudden clank surprises everyone. SANSA walks forward as soldiers begin to pound on the distant door to the crypt. The growls of wights are equally loud.

SOLDIER 1: Open the door!

SOLDIER 2: Open the door!

SOLDIER 3: Come on!

The soldiers begin to scream in pain.

SOLDIER 4: Open the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!

The screaming continues, then fades. Like the rest of those hiding in the crypt, SANSA returns the silence.

CUT TO: A passageway

The HOUND and BERIC inch though the dark passage, weapons ready. BERIC's flaming sword lights the way. Wights snarl in the distance. They approach each corner with great caution. A door at the end of the hallway crashes down, two grappling figures following it to the floor. A snarling wight assaults the desperate ARYA, who screams and grunts as she fend him off. BERIC throws his flaming sword down the length of the hall, spinning end over end. It pierces the the ghoul, throwing him off ARYA.

The HOUND battles with wights that pour into the hallway as BERIC pulls ARYA to her feet. A prone wight stabs BERIC in the ankle and he grunts in pain. ARYA runs and BERIC limps after, while the HOUND clears their path. The slow-moving BERIC kicks and fights with the wights who catch up to him. ARYA reaches the HOUND, and he pulls her along.

HOUND: Come on!

BERIC: Go!

HOUND: Come on!

BERIC stops to hold off the advancing wights. ARYA looks back with dismay.

BERIC: Run!

Attracted to the sounds of battle, wights shamble from many passages. The HOUND clears the way ahead. ARYA pulls BERIC behind her. He surges ahead to pin a wight against the wall. Other wights crash into them. One of the ghouls stabs BERIC in the gut with a dagger. ARYA picks up an axe to come to BERIC's aid. Nearby, the HOUND fells another wight, then looks up to see a mass of undead hustling down the hallway. He retreats back to his companions. ARYA helps the cowering BERIC to fight of the wights that grapple him. The HOUND picks her up from behind and carries her away. She resists.

HOUND: We've gotta go!

BERIC starts to follow, but the wights lying around him stab and grab his legs. He braces himself in pain. The HOUND and ARYA run, pursued by a horde of undead. The wights around BERIC stab and stab again. His energy starts to flag, but he breaks free and staggers away.

CUT TO: A chamber

The HOUND and ARYA burst through a door. BERIC staggers in behind them. He falls to the floor as they and slam the door behind them and hold it fast. ARYA props up BERIC against the fall while the HOUND barricades the door with a large wooden bench. The light fades from BERIC's eyes. ARYA looks at him pleadingly.

MELISANDRE: The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.

MELISANDRE stands by the fireplace.

ARYA: I know you.

MELISANDRE walks towards ARYA.

MELISANDRE: And I know you.

ARYA. stands to face MELISANDRE

ARYA: You said we'd meet again.

MELISANDRE: And here we are. At the end of the world.

ARYA: You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.

MELISANDRE: Brown eyes green eyes and blue eyes.

Wights snarl and crash against the door.

MELISANDRE: What do we say to the God of Death?

ARYA: Not today.

ARYA looks at MELISANDRE and then the HOUND. She jogs away from her companions, and they watch her go.

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON hears the wights snarling in the distance.

THEON: Here they come!

The soldiers ready their bows. Shadows streak through the snow-covered trees.

THEON: Steady, lads.

Soldiers grab arrows and set them aflame. They ready their bows.

THEON: Steady now. Make every shot count.

Shadows flit among the trees.

MAN 1: Over there!

The snarling grows louder and the wights charge out of the woods, frenzied and in great numbers.

MAN 2: There!

CUT TO: Above the battle.

Winterfell is surrounded by a moat of fire. Great swaths of field continue to burn where Drogon laid waste to the undead. The NIGHT KING and Viserion swoop down. The dragon expels powerful blue flame that destroys a great turret of the city wall and they speed across. The NIGHT KING looks backward to savor the damage, allowing JON and Rhaegal to intercept them. Rhaegal clutches Viserion in his claws, and the two dragons engage in a mid-air melee of claws and fangs

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON and the northern soldiers unleash their arrows at the charging wights. Just above them, Rhaegal and the undead Viserion battle and roar, flying jerkily towards the earth. The bite and rake one another with massive claws, slicing great wounds into each other.

JON: Get off.

Viserion clamps his jaws on the neck of Rhaegal and sinks his teeth in. JON struggles to hold on. The NIGHT KING readies a javelin. Viserion rips his jaws away, blue flame boiling in his mouth. He bites at JON, who twists to evade the massive jaws. Plumes of blue flame puff from Viserion as the dragon continues to snap and bite. Entangled, the dragons spiral downward. Then Drogon sweeps in, taking Viserion in his claws as he flied past. The NIGHT KING falls from his perch atop the dragon and plummets to the ground. JON holds onto Rhaegal for dear life. Drogon chomps deeply into the neck of the undead Dragon with a sickening crunch. Meanwhile, Rhaegal reaches the ground with incredible and tries to transition from flying to running. The velocity is too great, and the dragon ends up sliding on its belly, throwing JON to the ground. JON gathers himself, groaning and panting. Drogon roars above him, with DAENERYS riding assuredly astride him.

CUT TO: The courtyard

The courtyard is strewn with piles of bodies. TORMUND. GENDRY and JORAH fight on. Drogon roars above them. JORAH reacts, drawn to help DAENERYS.

CUT TO: Just above a field.

Drogon hovers above Winterfell. DAENERYS looks downs at the NIGHT KING. He stands in a field below them, looking up and seemingly unharmed by his perilous fall.

DAENERYS: Dracarys.

Drogon belches forth a spume of flame that envelops the stoic NIGHT KING. She looks down with vindication as Drogon spews a long and decimating fireball. Just below them, JON limps towards the conflagration. Drogon ceases his attack and DAENERYS watches the fire dissipate below her. JON gets as close as the heat will let him. Drogon squawks. The flames start to clear, revealing the NIGHT KING, confident, unhurt and unphased. He stares up to DAENERYS, smirking at his invulnerability DAENERYS is stunned. The NIGHT KING picks up the javelin beside him. DAENERYS immediately spurs Drogong to flee. The NIGHT KING hurls the javelin, which misses by inches as DAENERYS and Drogon turn and fly away.

Satisfied, the NIGHT KING strides through the smoldering and burning ground towards the Godswood. JON draws Longclaw and sets after the NIGHT KING at a brisk run. The NIGHT KING walks calmly toward his intended target. He cocks and ear backwards as JON draws closer. among the burning cinders. Alerted by JON's footsteps, the NIGhT KING turns to see him. JON pauses. The NIGHT KING plants his feet and spreads his hands, beginning a silent invocation. Appalled, JON sets off towards him at a sprint. However, he has too much ground to cover. The eyes of the undead soldiers between them open, a vacant milky blue. JON runs faster. Still fifty yards away, the slain soldiers sit up, then stand. JON gets within ten yards of the NIGHT KING before the newly risen wights block his progress completely. JON looks behind him to see scores of soldiers resurrected as undead warriors.

CUT TO: The courtyard.

TORMUND and JAIME continue to fight the undead, yelling and grunting as they dispatch their foes. JAIME pauses, astounded as the slain soldiers in Winterfell rise to their feet. GREY WORM pants for breath as the new undead rise in near silence. GREY WORM and SAM look on in horror. Nearby, TORMUND and GENDRY do the same. The wind whistles and the undead clumsily take their feet. Nearby, the eyes of LYANNA MORMONT pop open, showing milky blue irises, both piercing and lifeless. QHONO and EDDISON join the ranks of the undead.

CUT TO: The field

The NIGHT KING stands motionless and menacing. JON gasps for breath. The NIGHT KING turns his back to JON and walks away. Meanwhile, the crowd of the undead closes in slowly around JON. With no other option, he hacks at the undead that surround him.

CUT TO: The courtyard.

The undead continue to rise in the courtyard. Just beyond the wall, a score of white walkers strut towards the gate, weapons drawn.

CUT TO: The crypt

GILLY hears rustling and scratching behind her. She turns her head and gasps when a skeletal hand breaks through the wall of the crypt. A dried up corpse twists out its tomb and wriggles onto the floor, snarling. TYRION and SANSA look up at the disturbance. GILLY rises to investigate, as does SANSA. LITTLE SAM cries. The emaciated corpse gets to its feet. VARYS jumps up.

Behind the crowd, another wall starts to crumble. People stand and begin to scream in panic. Another Stark ancestor wriggles out of its tomb. The women and children flee to another part of the crypt.

TYRION: Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!

One woman falls in the panic, and is dragged backward into the dark catacomb.

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON and the northern soldiers expertly take down the charging wights with flaming arrows. They are successfully fending off the onslaught, but the wights are getting dangerously close. BRAN continues to warg with the crows, and sits motionless in his chair.

CUT TO: The field

JON parries the lumbering undead that threaten to surround him, vastly overwhelmed by the swarm of wights that advance towards him. Suddenly, a wall of fire ignites just behind JON, consuming the wights. JON ducks and shields himself from the heat. The wights shriek and chitter as they collapse and die in the inferno. JON catches his breath, and looks up to DAENERYS and Drogon, hovering above. The mighty dragon continues to spew forth hits flame breath. JON squints as he peers into the destruction of the flames. Drogon sets down heavily behind him, and roars.

JON: Bran!

DAENERYS: Go!

JON runs towards Winterfell, tracing a path through the walls of flame that still burn. Behind Drogon, more undead run at full tilt. DAENERYS watches JON make his way to Winterfell, and doesn't see the new assault until they are leaping on her dragon. They swarm on Drogon's tail and flanks. The dragon shakes and whips most of them off. But those that hang on stab mercilessly into the hide of Drogon. The dragon roars and screeches as the frantic stabbing continues. DAENERYS grunts as she tries to stay on Drogon in spite of his contortions. She is thrown to the ground while the wights continues to swarm over Drogon. The dragon labors and takes flight, undulating with great effort. The swarm of undead soldiers loses their grip as the dragon flies higher.

DAENERYS watches as wights crash into the ground in front of her. They are bloodied and broken, but unphased by the traumatic wounds. They snap their attention onto DAENERYS. She crab walks backward in fear. One gruesome, pale wight charges her, but is decapitated by JORAH at the last second. He grabs DAENERYS and leads her away.

CUT TO: Winterfell courtyard.

JON has reached the courtyard. A constant stream of bodies pours down from the parapets above. JON struggles to walk through the mounds of bodies that cover the courtyard floors. He passes GENDRY and TORMUND, who continue to battle the awful horde of undead. JON staggers onward to tackle a greater purpose. He passes SAM who lied propped against another mound of bodies, frenetically stabbing the undead who cling to him. JON hacks through an attacking wight, and looks backwards as SAM screams, desperate and panicked. JON turns his back on his friend and continues forward, meeting the attacks that try to impede him. GREY WORM twirls his spear in a deadly whirlwind of precision. BRIENNE releases guttural grunts and screams as she hews through her foes. She is dangerously close to being overwhelmed, but JON does not pause.

JON enters a passageway, where the battle continues is close quarters. He dispatches those that try to stop them, and dodges the debris that falls from above. He stumbles, buried momentarily, but regains his feet and lurches through an iron gate that he slams shut behind him. Undead soldering slam against the portal, hissing and grabbing at JON. The gate holds fast, and JON launches away further down the hall.

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON pants as he takes a few paces backward, notches a flaming arrow and fires. He readies another arrow, but the wights are starting to get the upper hand, tacking the northerners and encroaching on BRAN, who continues to sit helpless while warging. THEON reaches for another arrow, but his bucket is empty. He bats down one wight with his bow, but is tackled by another. He squirms away, as the wight charges again. THEON yells as he raises a spear that impales the oncoming ghoul. THEON stands and leverages the wight away from BRAN. He switches to hand-to-hand combat with the spear.

CUT TO: The field

JORAH leads DAENERYS through the burning wreckage of the battlefield outside the walls of Winterfell. He chops down an undead Dothraki. DAENERYS picks up a sword she sees on the ground. JORAH gores another two wights, and then the undead start to run at them from all sides.

CUT TO: The crypt

The reanimated Stark ancestors his and shriek as they attack the women, children and elderly in the crypt. Women scream as they are clawed and chewed by the desiccated undead. TYRION pokes his head out from behind the tomb where he and SANSA are hiding. SANSA is overwhelmed, panting as she listens to the screams of her people. TYRION keeps peeking around the tomb, scheming for some opportunity to improve their situation. He and SANSA catch one another's eye, and she regains her focus. She pulls out her dragonglass knife. They exchange a long and affectionate look. TYRION pulls her gloved hand to his lips and kisses it. He gives a quick smile. He exhales sharply and turns quickly around the side of the tomb.

CUT TO: The courtyard.

JON continues his progress towards the godswood. Viserion roars above him. He looks up and spins, trying to locate the dragon. Viserion lands atop the gate in front of him and belches forth blue fire. JON ducks reflexively at the impact. Viserion turns his fire breath into the courtyard, and JON flees back the way he came, barely escaping the torrent of blue flame that blasts down the hallway.

CUT TO: Another part of the courtyard

JAIME and BRIENNE struggle against the overwhelming numbers of the undead. TORMUND and GREY WORM do the same.

CUT TO: The field

JORAH and DAENERYS stave off their attackers among the burning rubble by the trenches. One wight stabs JORAH in the side before he and his queen work together to dispatch him. JORAH staggers to his knees. but regains his stance. The fight continues.

DAENERYS: Jorah!

CUT TO: The crypt

Women and children try to flee the reanimated Starks corpses. SANSA swivels to take a look. TYRION seizes his moment and makes a break across the chamber, followed by SANSA. He reaches an alcove where VARYS and some others have taken refuge. He looks for his next opportunity.

CUT TO: The side courtyard

JON is pressed against a wall, panting and exhausted. As he peers around the corner, a mass of battling wights falling through the far passage as the gate gives way. JON runs back into the courtyard where Viserion sits atop the wall. Fires burn everywhere and the undead dragon roars and shifts, causing further destruction . The dragon slides down into the courtyard itself. JON slays and wight, and turns to run and Viserion unleashes a vortex blue flame at JON. He turns a corner to escape the attack, and presses himself against the wall.

CUT TO: The courtyard

As fires rage nearby, TORMUND loses his footing as he fends of the wights. JAIME and PODRICK have their backs against the wall as the undead overwhelm them. BRIENNE screams as a wight bites at her shoulder. SAM sniffles as he leans exhausted and helpless on a pile of his fallen comrades.

CUT TO: The godswood

The NIGHT KING and the white walkers stride through the godswood. THEON lands one mortal blow after another to keep the charging wights away from BRAN. He pauses, doubled over, exhausted and gasping for breath. The wights stop their attack and stand motionless. They part to allow the NIGHT KING to walk through. BRAN returns to consciousness. THEON looks at the NIGHT KING, who stands motionless at the end of the aisle created by his followers.

BRAN: Theon.

THEON turns to look at BRAN.

BRAN: You're a good man.

THEON: (Nods.)

BRAN: Thank you.

THEON takes a breath. A single tear falls from his eye, and he looks down. He turns back to face the NIGHT KING, and gives the slightest of nods at his foe. The NIGHT KING takes a step forward. THEON readies his spear, then charges the NIGHT KING with a battle yell. THEON runs the length of the clearing at full tilt. In a single motion, the NIGHT KING side steps THEON's attack, grabs the spear, breaks it in two and impales THEON through the gut. THEON grunts, looks up at the NIGHT KING's expressionless face, and falls quivering to his knees. The NIGHT KING shifts his gaze to BRAN. THEON falls and BRAN looks down.

CUT TO: The side courtyard

JON remains pinned behind a wall as Viserion spurts blue flame in the courtyard where he crouches. JON tries to dart past him, but Viserion turns. He blasts forth blue flame, and JON scampers behind a ruined wall, and lies prone, trapped by the blue incineration above.

CUT TO: The godswood

THEON lies on the ground, the half spear piercing his stomach. He twitches and looks up at the NIGHT KING. The NIGHT KING walks on, leaving the helpless THEON to draw his final breath. Blood pours from his mouth, he gives a weak spasm, and he expires.

CUT TO: The field

DAENERYS helps JORAH up from among the the glowing, devastated landscape. A wight charges DAENERYS from behind, and JORAH throws himself into the way. The undead's blade penetrates JORAH's heart.

CUT TO: The godswood

The NIGHT KING draws closer. BRAN does not even look at him as he closes the final steps to his wheelchair. The NIGHT KING stops just next to BRAN's chair, and BRAN finally turns his head and looks up. Their eyes meet and they ponder one another. The NIGHT KING cocks his head slightly.

CUT TO: The side courtyard

Viserion's face is just on the other side of the broken wall where JON lies hiding. JON steels himself, and stands up tall, facing the dragon, hands and sword at his side. He yells out a challenging cry. Viserion opens his great jaws to unleash a blast to rip JON apart.

CUT TO: The godswood

BRAN and the NIGHT KING calmly look eye-to-eye. The NIGHT KING reaches back to unsheathe his weapon from its shoulder scabbard. A faint wind moves the hair of a nearby white walker. As the NIGHT KING is about the grab the hilt of his sword, ARYA appears, leaping through the darkness at the NIGHT KING's back. Her scream gives her away and the NIGHT KING swivels around, grabbing her by the throat with one hand and staying her knife hand with the other. ARYA drops the knife of Valyrian steel, and the NIGHT KING's eyes follow its plummet. ARYA catches the knife in her free right hand and buries it in the NIGHT KING's stomach with a grunt. The NIGHT KING shatters into tiny ice shards which rain down. ARYA lands crouching on her hands and feel, panting.

One by one, the white walkers explore into ice shards. The crowd of wights that surround BRAN and AYRA fall over, lifeless as rag dolls.

CUT TO: The side courtyard

JON stares down his death as Viserion rears up and roars. Suddenly, the dragon collapses, a lifeless husk, leaving a whiff of blue flame to dissipate in the air

CUT TO: The courtyard

The horde of undead collapse to the ground, falling away from those they were just battling. Many others tumble from the parapet into the courtyard.

CUT TO: The exterior wall

The undead pyramid the wights used to scale the wall collapses. The waves of undead rushing towards Winterfell fall down.

CUT TO: The field

When the undead collapse, JORAH falls to his knees, DAENERYS standing just behind. Then he slumps to the ground.

JORAH: I'm hurt.

CUT TO: The side courtyard

JON stares in disbelief.

CUT TO: The courtyard

TORMUND, GANDRY and GREY WORM are stunned. They look out at the lifeless mounds of friend and foe. Nearby, BRIENNE, JAIME and PODRICK, lean against the wall, dumbfounded at their sudden escape from sure death.

CUT TO: The crypt

TYRION and SANSA stand motionless. VARYS walks up from behind, leading women and children to join them. GILLY stands with LITTLE SAM. The undead have turned into piles of dust and bone fragments.

CUT TO: The godswood.

ARYA looks out from the weirwoord. A gentle snow falls. She looks back at BRAN. He looks back, pleased.

CUT TO: The field. {DAENERYS sobs over JORAH's listless body. He tries to say something, but goes still, eyes glazed by death. As she sobs, Drogon curls loosely around her to comfort her.

CUT TO: The gate

The HOUND comes out of the darkened doorway, followed by MELISANDRE. The HOUND stops, bent.over in relief. But the red woman continues walking. She walks out the gate, down a snowy aisle flanked by piles of dead bodies. DAVOS appears at the gate at watches her walk towards the snowy field beyond. She sheds her red cloak as she walks, and then her metal choker. Her walk becomes unsteady and her hair turns from red to white. Her dress slides off her shoulders as she shrinks down aging countless years in seconds. She gives off a cloud of dust as she collapses into an emaciated and lifeless pile.

CREDITS

EXT: Winterfell, day

JORAH's body lies on an unlit funeral pyre. DAENERYS mourns over his prone body. She leans down and kisses him gently on the forehead. She then whispers something in his ear.

SANSA weeps over THEON’s dead body, her hand on his chest. She steps back and takes a Stark wolf pin from her chest and secures it on THEON's.

JON, ARYA, SAM and BRAN stand amidst the Stark men, some of whom bear torches. DAENERYS joins the crowd a bit further down, next to GREY WORM, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION. In front of the crowd sits scores of funeral pyres in a grid. Stark soldiers stand at intervals with more torches. SANSA returns to the somber crowd, joining her siblings. Even Grey Wolf stands obediently in mourning. JON steps forward to address those assembled.

JON: We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.

Soldiers and freefolk hand torches to JON, SANSA, ARYA, SAM, TORMUND, DAENERYS and GREY WORM. They fan out to various pyres in the field, joining their fallen comrades for one final VISIT: ARYA to BERIC, SAM to EDDISON TOLLETT, JON to LYANNA MORMONT. JON looks at DAENERYS. As one, they ignite the pyres. DAENYRYS watches the flames spread under JORAH, then turns away. The living return to the crowd and the flames rise higher. The air fills with a thick black smoke.

INT: Winterfell Great Hall

The victory feast is somber and quiet, even though the hall is filled to capacity. At the head table sites BRAN, SANSA, JON, DAENERYS and TYRION.

MAN: To your health.

In the crowd, GENDRY looks around. He turns back to the table where the HOUND eats hungrily. GENDRY takes a drink.

GENDRY: Have you seen Arya?

HOUND: You can still smell the burning bodies, and that’s where your head is at.

GENDRY: I just want to thank her for--

HOUND: I'm sure you do.

GENDRY: Look, it's not about that.

HOUND: Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.

The HOUND takes a deep gulp of his wine. GENDRY gets up, insulted. He walks the length of the hall to exit, but DAENERYS notices him as he passes the head table.

DAENERYS: Gendry.

GENDRY stops and faces her. The hall goes even quieter.

DAENERYS: That's right, isn't it?

GENDRY approaches DAENERYS.

GENDRY: Yes, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: You’re Robert Baratheon’s son.

GENDRY: (nods)

DAENERYS: You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?

GENDRY: I didn’t even know he was my father until after he was dead.

DAENERYS: Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

GENDRY: I don’t know, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Does anyone?

No one in the hall responds.

DAENERYS:I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.

The crowd murmurs.

GENDRY: I can't be. I'm a bastard.

DAENERYS: No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.

GENDRY nods in shock and surprise. At a nearby table, DAVOS stands and raises his glass.

DAVOS: To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.

Everyone in the hall rises to their feet to salute GENDRY.

ALL: To Gendry!

MAN 1: Lord Gendry!

MAN 2: Gendry!

MAN 3: Gendry!

MAN 4: Gendry!

GENDRY takes a goblet from the smiling JON SNOW.

MAN 5: Lord Gendry!

GENDRY salutes the hall. They cheer in response.

MAN 6: Gendry!

The HOUND, still sitting, shakes his head and returns to shoveling food into his mouth. The hall contiunes to cheer.

MAN 7: That's easy, isn't it?

TYRION; A fitting reward for a hero.

SAM: (to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.

TYRION: And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.

MAN 8: (to GENDRY) Come, my lord.

DAENERYS: See? You're not the only one who's clever.

SANSA looks at DAENERYS with concern, pondering the play that the Mother of Dragons has just made.

WOMAN: I have to go down and get another barrel.

CUT TO: The Winterfell Great Hall, a bit later.

The mood has lightened. The merry crowd laughs and enjoys themselves. The wine flows freely. A server places a carafe of wine on the table in front of JAIME and BRIENNE.

JAIME: We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?

JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself. BRIENNE watches, a bit nervous. They clink glasses and drink together.

CUT TO: Another part of the Hall

DAVOS and TYRION stand talking.

DAVOS: The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

TYRION: I'm sure you had your reasons.

DAVOS: I did. I do.

TYRION: So did you?

DAVOS: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?

TYRION: I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.

DAVOS: And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

TYRION: Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.

DAVOS: Thank you. I feel much better.

DAVOS takes the wine that TYRION has poured for him and drinks. TYRION exits.

CUT TO: Another part of the hall

The celebrations are becoming raucous. The HOUND takes the entire pitcher of wine from a serving wench as she passes.

CUT TO: A fireplace in the hall

TYRION looks into the fire, pensively.

MAN: More ale!

TYRION address BRAN, who sits nearby.

TYRION: This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.

BRAN: It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.

TYRION: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

BRAN: I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

TYRION: You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

BRAN doesn't answer.

TYRION: You don't want it.

BRAN: I don't really want anymore.

TYRION: I envy you.

BRAN: You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.

CUT TO: The head table

TORMUND goads JON into drinking from his horn.

TORMUND: All of it.

MAN: Go on.

JON: No, not in one go.

SANSA: Go on. I believe in you.

TORMUND: We have to celebrate our victory.

JON: Vomiting is not celebrating.

TORMUND: Yes, it is.

Everyone laughs. TORMUND holds up the drinking horn in salute.

TORMUND: Ah! To the Dragon Queen!

Everyone in the hall cheers. DAENERYS stands.

DAENERYS: To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

Everyone stands and cheers again, even louder. Only the HOUND remains seated in disdain for the celebration.

ALL: Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

WOMAN: Drink!

TORMUND tips the great horn back and drinks for an inordinately long time. He roars. JON and SANSA smile. SANSA watches DAENERYS again, then stands and exits.

TORMUND: I'm fine!

DAENERYS returns to her seat, sitting alone while TORMUND continues to spur on the drunken revelry nearby. The hall is abuzz with merriment.

CUT TO: A table nearby.

TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE and PODRICK are playing a drinking game.

TYRION: (drunkenly) Your turn.

JAIME: (to BRIENNE) Um You are an only child.

BRIENNE: I told you I was.

JAIME: You didn't.

BRIENNE: I did.

JAIME: I surmised it.

TYRION: Drink.

Humorously scoffing, BRIENNE drinks.

TYRION: Go again.

BRIENNE: Why does he get to go again?

TYRION: Because it's my game.

JAIME: You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

PODRICK: (to Brienne) No.

TYRION: Drink.

CUT TO: The revelry near the head table.

TORMUND is quite drunk and vociferous as he celebrates with JON, DAVOS and some free folk.

MAN: The other way around!

TORMUND: I saw him riding that thing.

DAVOS: We all did.

TORMUND: No. No. I saw him riding that thing.

JON SNOW, sitting behind him, shakes his head and laughs. He takes another drink as he listens.

DAVOS: That's right, you did.

TORMUND: I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.

Sitting just beyond the group, DAENERYS notices the praise that JON is getting. She watches closely. TORMUND puts his hand of JON's shoulder with drunken affection. He then throws his arm around JON's shoulder.

TORMUND: (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!

DAERNERYS continues to jealously observe the adulation that JON receives. A coffee cup rests on the table next to her.

TORMUND: Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.

TORMUND firmly slaps JON on the back. JON winces in pain.

TORMUND: Not this one.

The men laugh.

JON: Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

TORMUND: Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

DAENERYS grows more unhappy with the attention that JON is getting instead of her.

TORMUND: He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!

The crowd cheers. JON looks at DAENERYS. She toasts him with her glass. TORMUND continues to laugh as DAENERYS looks around the room, with VARYS standing in the wings behind her. She looks at the drinking game between TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE and PODRICK.

TYRION: Drink.

JAIME: Drink.

PODRICK: Drink.

BRIENNE drinks. They all laugh.

DAENERYS looks back at JON and TORMUND, deeling let out. She stands quickly. VARYS stands in response. As she exits, VARYS bows to her, then watches her go with concern.

CUT TO: The drinking game.

TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE and PODRICK are deep in their cups.

BRIENNE: Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

BRIENNE and TYRION laugh. TYRION drinks.

TYRION: Mm!

BRIENNE: You were married. Before Sansa.

JAIME: Drink.

TYRION growls and drinks.

BRIENNE: You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!

TYRION: No!

TYRION laughs drunkenly, and BRIENNE drinks, smiling.

TYRION: You're a virgin.

BRIENNE's face falls. PODRICK drinks nervously. JAIME tries to save the mood.

JAIME: That's a statement about the present.

TYRION: At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman.

BRIENNE goes from flabbergasted to angry in the course a moment. She stands.

BRIENNE: I have to piss.

TORMUND approaches them

TORMUND: We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?

TORMUND guffaws.

BRIENNE: Please pardon me for a moment.

BRIENNE exits, and the drunken TORMUND moves to follow. JAIME stands quickly and blocks him. They exchange a look. JAIME jovially pats TORMUND on the shoulder to stay him, then turns to follow BRIENNE. Woundedly, TORMUND watches BRIENNE leave, tailed by JAIME. TYRION gets his attention by pouring his wine into TORMUND's drinking horn.

MAN: Drink it!

TYRION's eyes hold TORMUND's gaze as he clinks his glass with the drinking horn. He exits and PODRICK smirks. TORMUND digests the reality of the situation. He returns to his freefolk friends. PODRICK watches him go, and his eyes meet those of a Stark maiden, who smiles at him. He smiles back.

CUT TO: The main hall, later.

TORMUND, confessional and teary, pours his heart out to the HOUND. TORMUND; And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me. sJust takes her, like that. I mean it, Clegane. My heart is broken.

TORMUND clasps the HOUND's shoulder.

HOUND: Don't touch me.

WILLA: You can touch me.

TORMUND swivels quickly to find WILLA and SARRA standing nearby.

WILLA: I'm not afraid of wildlings.

TORMUND: Maybe you should be.

SANSA watches their interaction from afar. TORMUND chuckles and hugs WILLA close to him

TORMUND: Well, Clegane it's time to drown our sorrows.

HOUND: I'm not done with my drink.

TORMUND sighs and grabs the pitcher from WILLA. He sets it down on a nearby table. They exit.

MAN 2: You saved the day.

MAN 1: You owe me one. Don't forget that.

MAN 2: For the rest of my days.

While the HOUND drains his glass and plunks it on the table, SARRA walks to the other side of him and sits.

SARRA: Are you ready now?

The HOUND grabs a large pitcher from the table in front of him and refills his glass.

HOUND: This is my drink.

SARRA looks across the room to SANSA. She tries to re-engage the HOUND, but he lurches agressively at her, growling. SARRA recoils, then exits quickly

MAN: All right!

SANSA approaches the HOUND and sits down across from him.

SANSA: She could have made you happy, for a little while.

HOUND: There's only one thing that'll make me happy.

SANSA: And what's that?

HOUND: That's my fucking business.

SANSA returns his brush off with silence.

HOUND: Used to be you couldn't look at me.

SANSA: That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.

HOUND: Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough.

SANSA: And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.

HOUND: How?

SANSA: Hounds.

The HOUND chuckles.

HOUND: You've changed, Little Bird.

The HOUND takes a deep drink.

HOUND: None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me. No Littlefinger, no Ramsay none of it.

SANSA clasps his hand, gently. He looks down at the kindness, then back at her eyes.

SANSA: Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.

SANSA gathers herself, stands and exits. The HOUND ponders.

EXT: Winterfell courtyard.

The rowdiness continues to increase, as the party spills out into the courtyard

MAN 1: Hey!

MAN 2: Pour another one.

GENDRY searches for ARYA. He enters a passageway away from the festivities. He is startled by an arrow that pierces the wall just in front of his face. He turns to see ARYA holding the bow. He raises both hands in surrender, and enters.

GENDRY: Don't shoot.

ARYA notches another bow.

GENDRY: It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating with them.

ARYA: I am celebrating.

She launches the arrow at a makeshift target tacked to a barrel. She picks up another arrow.

GENDRY: Yeah, I am too. I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore. I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. By order of the queen.

ARYA: Congratulations.

GENDRY grabs her quickly and kisses her.

GENDRY: I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me. So be with me.

GENDRY kneels before ARYA

GENDRY: Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.

ARYA bends down and kisses GENDRY. They stand together.

ARYA: You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not a lady. I never have been. That's not me.

ARYA readies another arrow, and lets it fly.

INT: BRIENNE chambers, night.

BRIENNE adds a log to the fire that burns in the hearth. There is a knock on the door. BRIENNE walks over and opens the door. JAIME stands at, leaning drunkenly against the wall.

JAIME: You didn't drink.

JAIME invites himself in. He places a pitcher on the table, and grabs the two glasses nestled the elbow of his right arm. BRIENNE is a bit confused, but she closes the door and walks over.

BRIENNE: I didn't drink?

JAIME: In the game.

BRIENNE: I drank.

JAIME picks up the pitcher to pour a glass of wine.

JAIME: In the game. This is Dornish.

BRIENNE: This is not the game. This is only drinking.

JAIME hands her a full glass.

JAIME: Suit yourself.

BRIENNE drinks, a puzzled look on her face.

JAIME: You keep it warm enough in here.

JAIME slides off his jacket, with a bit of difficultly, and throws it down on the table.

BRIENNE: It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North. Keep your fire going. Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.

JAIME: That's very diligent. Very responsible.

BRIENNE: Piss off.

JAIME: You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.

BRIENNE: It grows on you.

JAIME: I don't want things growing on me.

JAIME fills the other glass with a sloppy pour.

JAIME: How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.

JAIME drinks. BRIENNE's expression softens.

BRIENNE: (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.

JAIME: (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.

JAIME works to undo the lacing of his shirt. It is not easy to do it one-handed. He chuckles in embarrassment at his ineptitude. He tries using his left hand and his teeth. BRIENNE realizes that this is a drunken seduction. She swats his hand away.

BRIENNE: Oh, move aside.

BRIENNE undoes JAIME's shirt. He starts doing the same for her.

BRIENNE: What are you doing?

JAIME: I'm taking your shirt off.

They both pause at look at one another. BRIENNE undoes her own shirt as he watches. She them helps JAIME to pull his shirt over his heads. She then peels off her own shirt.

JAIME: I've never slept with a knight before.

BRIENNE: I've never slept with anyone before.

JAIME: Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.

BRIENNE: I told you--

JAIME cuts her short with a hungry kiss. She returns in kind.

INT: Winterfell, JON's chambers, night

JON sits at the table, his head propped up on one fist, tired or drunk or both. DAENERYS opens the door and enters.

DAENERYS: Are you drunk?

JON looks at her for a beat.

JON: No.

JON stands and stumbles a bit. He laughs at himself.

JON: Only a little.

DAENERYS shuts the door and moves closer.

JON: I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you.

DAENERYS: He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you.

They embrace.

DAENERYS: Is that all right?

JON and DAENERYS kiss, gently at first. Their passion builds and they start to undress one another while still kissing. JON pulls back, a conflicted look on his face. DAENERYS responds with dejection. JON moves away.

DAENERYS: I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.

She sits.

DAENERYS: I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.

JON: I told you I don't want it.

DAENERYS: (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?

JON kneels before her.

JON: I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.

DAENERYS quickly takes JON's face in her hands and looks him straight in the eye.

DAENERYS: (desperately)You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.

JON stands. DAENERYS takes his hand in hers.

DAENERYS: I want it to be the way it was between us.

JON returns her touch.

JON: I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

DAENERYS: Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.

JON: She won't.

DAENERYS: She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.

JON: I owe them the truth.

DAENERYS: Even if the truth destroys us?

JON: It won't.

DAENERYS: It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.

JON cups her face in his hands.

JON: You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.

DAENERYS: We can. I've just told you how.

JON lets his hands fall. DAENERYS walks away.

INT: BRIENNE's chambers, night

BRIENNE and JAIME lie in bed, naked. BRIENNE is fast asleep. JAMIE looks at her, breaths deeply, then stares towards the ceiling.

INT: WInterfell war room, day.

The room contains a map of Westeros with stone pieces representing the forces at Winterfell and King's Landing. The war council consists of MISSANDEI, DAENERYS, VARYS, GREY WORM, TYRION, JON, ARYA, SANSA, QHONO, SAM, BRAN, MAESTER WOLKAN, DAVOS and BRIENNE. The mood is somber and tense.

GREY WORM picks up a handful of Winterfell markers.

GREY WORM: Half are gone.

JON: The Northmen as well.

JON slides of some other markers. MAESTER WOLKAN slides away some more. VARYS places additional markers in King's Landing.

VARYS: And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.

MISSANDEI: When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them--

DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.

TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.

DAENERYS: No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital.

TYRION: I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.

JON: We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.

TYRION: Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.

DAENERYS thinks before responding.

DAENERYS: All right.

SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.

DAENERYS: How long do you suggest?

SANSA: I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.

DAENERYS: I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

SANSA: It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?

DAENERYS:THE longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.

JON: (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

JON turns to face DAENERYS

JON: What you command, we will obey.

ARYA and SANSA exchange a glance.

TYRION: So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.

JON moves the corresponding markers on the map.

TYRION: A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.

GREY WORM moves those markers into position.

TYRION: Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

DAENERYS: We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.

Everyone exits, except for the Stark children. ARYA intercepts JON as he begins to leave. SANSA moves to stand beside BRAN.

ARYA: We need a word.

EXT: Winterfell godswood, day

The Stark children discuss the situation in the godswood.

JON: You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.

SANSA: Arya's the one that killed the Night King.

JON: Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--

SANSA: And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--

JON: I swore myself and the North to her cause.

ARYA: I respect that.

SANSA: You respect it?

ARYA: We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.

JON: You don't know her yet.

ARYA: I'll never know her. She's not one of us.

JON: If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.

ARYA: That's all right. I don't need many allies.

JON: Arya -

ARYA: We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.

JON: I've never been a Stark.

SANSA: You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.

ARYA: You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.

JON hesitates.

BRAN: It's your choice.

SANSA and ARYA look to BRAN, confused.

JON: I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.

ARYA: What is it?

JON: You have to swear it, before I tell you.

SANSA: How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?

JON: Because we're family. Swear it.

ARYA: I swear it.

SANSA: I swear it.

JON: (to BRAN) Tell them.

SANSA and ARYA turn to BRAN.

EXT: A Winterfell house, night

Two cloaked people walk by the modest house

INT: The Winterfell house

JAIME and TYRION talk by the fire.

TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you?

JAIME: She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.

TYRION: I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.

They both laugh

TYRION: Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains.

TYRION and JAIME clink their glasses in a toast.

JAIME: To climbing mountains.

They drink.

TYRION: What's she like down there?

JAIME: What? That's not your concern.

TYRION: I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.

JAIME: You're a dog.

TYRION: I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

BRONN enters. He cavalierly holds JOFFREY's crossbow

BRONN: I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall, blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.

TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you-- What are you doing up North?

JAIME motions to the crossbow.

JAIME: What are you doing with that?

BRONN: Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.

TYRION: You're supposed to be south.

BRONN sits next to them.

BRONN: You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?

TYRION: That's a bit rude.

BRONN: Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, - and what do I have to show?

TYRION: You're a knight, thanks to me.

BRONN: Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.

JAIME: Power resides where men believe--

BRONN: Shut your mouth.

TYRION: I'm just trying--

BRONN: I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.

TYRION: See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--

BRONN pivots in his seat and gives TYRION a left hook to the face. JAIME jerks to his feet. In a fluid motion, BRONN leans back and threatens JAIME with the crossbow

BRONN: You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone.

TYRION tips his head back and groans, holding his nose with both hands.

TYRION: You broke my nose!

BRONN: I did not break your nose.

TYRION: How do you know?

BRONN: Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.

JAIME: And you trust Cersei--

BRONN: I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

BRONN picks up a cup of wine and drinks deeply.

BRONN: Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden -

TYRION: May I speak?

BRONN: Why not? Only death will shut you up.

TYRION: We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?

BRONN: If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?

TYRION: Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.

JAIME: Highgarden? Are you mad?

TYRION: It's better than being dead.

JAIME: He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if--

BRONN unleashes a crossbow bolt just past JAIME's head. They both are taken by surprise, and go silent at the threat. BRONN reloads.

BRONN: The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.

JAIME: Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.

BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.

BRONN takes another drink

BRONN: Highgarden. Give me your word.

TYRION: You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses. BRONN; (chuckles) Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don't die.

BRONN stands up and backs out of the room, keeping the crossbow trained on the the Lannisters. He shuts the door behind him. JAIME and TYRION look to one another.

EXT: Outside of Winterfell, day.

The HOUND rides though the gray and snowy landscape, chewing on some jerky. He sees something in the distance.

HOUND: For fuck's sake.

ARYA rides up next to him. Annoyed, the HOUND throws his jerky on the ground .

ARAY: On your own?

They ride side by side.

HOUND: Not anymore. I don't like crowds.

ARYA: Me neither.

HOUND: Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.

ARYA: Don't like heroes.

HOUND: It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.

ARYA: Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?

HOUND: I have some unfinished business.

ARYA: Me too.

HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.

ARYA: Neither do I.

HOUND: Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?

ARYA: Probably.

The HOUND laughs. ARYA smiles.

EXT: Hills outside Winterfell.

DAENERYS pets the growling RHAEGAL, who then takes flight. DROGON and DAENERYS watch RHAEGAL take flight. DAENERYS smiles and turns to climb onto DROGON.

EXT: Winterfell walkway

SANSA watches the dragons soar through the air. TYRION approaches.

TYRION: My lady.

Distracted by the flying dragons, SANSA does not answer.

TYRION: "My lord" is the standard response.

SANSA: Why her?

TYRION: You know she loves your brother.

SANSA: That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.

TYRION: You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.

SANSA: Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.

TYRION: I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.

SANSA: Well, I suppose that's up to him.

TYRION: Sansa, look at me.

SANSA takes her eyes off the dragons and slowly turns to look at TYRION.

TYRION: With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.

SANSA: What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--

TYRION: She's your queen too.

The Unsullied march in time out the main gate of Winterfell. SANSA and TYRION both turn to watch.

TYRION: You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, - or the North, or--?

SANSA: You're afraid of her.

TYRION: Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.

SANSA: I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.

TYRION: No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.

SANSA gives an exasperated sigh and turns away.

TYRION: Are you all right?

SANSA mulls the information she knows about JON's heritage.

TYRION: Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her.

TYRION starts to walk away.

SANSA: Tyrion. What if there's someone else? Someone better?

EXT: Winterfell courtyard.

DAVOS mounts his steed while JON packs his saddle. TORMUND approachs.

TORMUND: You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

JON shakes is head, amused by the jibe. He walks to meet TORMUND half way.

JON: Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.

TORMUND: (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

JON: (laughs)

TORMUND: I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.

JON: This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

TORMUND: It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.

JON looks at Ghost.

JON: It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.

TORMUND: So would you.

JON: I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then.

TORMUND: You never know.

TORMUND and JON hug.

TORMUND: You've got the North in you. The real North.

TORMUND exits. JON walks to meet SAM and GILLY. JON gives GILLY a hug, and is surprised by her baby bump. She looks at her belly, smiling. SAM nods to confirm that she is pregnant.

SAM: Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we--

GILLY: I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

JON: I hope it's a girl.

JON and SAM hug, both of them holding back tears.

SAM: You're the best friend I ever had.

JON: You too, Sam.

JON walks away. Ghost whines as he passes. JON mounts, and rides out of the gate with DAVOS. TORMUND, Ghost, SAM and GILLY watch him go.

EXT: The open sea

The Targaryen fleet cuts sails at a fine clip. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI stand together on deck. MISSANDEI discreetly clasps GREY WORM's hand. He looks down at their hands and the smile at one another.

INT: The captain's quarters

TYRION sits, talking with VARYS, who stands nearby.

TYRION: Think of the past 20 years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.

VARYS: How many others know?

VARYS sits.

TYRION: Including us? Eight.

VARYS: Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?

TYRION: She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.

VARYS: No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne.

TYRION: He doesn't want the throne.

TYRION begins to pace.

VARYS: I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero.

TYRION: He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together.

VARYS: She's his aunt.

TYRION: That never stopped a Targaryen before.

VARYS: No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.

TYRION: Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.

VARYS: I worry about her state of mind.

TYRION: We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.

EXT: Dragonstone harbor.

A ship drops anchor, and another furls its sails. Others in the distance have already set anchor. Rhaegal and Drogon fly overhead, with DAENERYS riding. They soar over the castle, enjoying themselves. Suddenly, a huge bolt pierces Rhaegal's chest. He screeches in pain. DAENERYS is baffled and distraught. Rhaegal struggles to continue flying. Another bolt plunges into his chest, and a third pierces his neck. Blood spurts and the mighty dragon tumbles towards the sea.

CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet.

TYRION and VARYS race to the deck, in time to see Rhaegal plunge into the sea just off the side of their ship, upside down and unconscious. Men shout in confusion and race around the deck. Rhaegel disappears below the foamy splash.

CUT TO: The sky overhead.

DAENERYS looks down in horror. Another giant bolt zooms just above her head. She ducks in surprise, and looks up to see the Ironborn fleet appear from behind the craggy shores of Blackwater. Scorpions have been mounted on their foredecks. EURON himself mans one of the scorpions. His crew repositions the huge siege weapon for another shot. Rage takes over DAENERYS as she guides Drogon to dive towards the Ironborn. She screams a war cry. EURON patiently waits for his shot. The Ironborn let loose a volley of bolts, forcing DAENERYS to veer away from her attack dive. Drogon escapes unscathed, tailed by bolts as he retreats. DAENERYS reels and seeths.

CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet

MISSANDEI and TYRION watch DAENERYS fly away.

CUT TO: The sky overhead

DAENERYS is consumed by fury. Then she lowers he head in mourning.

CUT TO: The Ironborn fleet

EURON watches DAENERYS fly away. He smiles as his men repositions his weapon towards the vulnerable Targaryen ships.

CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet

MISSANDEI runs to GREY WORM's side.

GREY WORM: Get to the skiff.

MISSANDEI hesitates.

GREY WORM: Now!

MISSANDEI retreats.

TYRION takes stock of the attacking Ironborn ships, coming towards them at full sail.

SOLDIER 1: Spears!

SOLDIER 2: They're coming round again!

CUT TO: The Ironborn fleet

EURON takes aim with a menacing smile. He lets loose the bolt with a grunt. The other ships follow suit, sending off a brutal assault

CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet

The volley of giant bolts takes apart the Targaryen ships. GREY WORM is knocked off his feet by the devastating force of impact.

SOLDIER 3: Go!

SOLDIER 4: Clear!

SOLDIER 5: Man your stations!

MISSANDEI: No!

The sea spurts over the railings as the massive bolts destroy the hull. TYRION pivots away from the attacking side and is nearly impaled on a whistling bolt. He falls backwards with a grunt. He quickly swivels back to his feet and changes direction. Another mighty bolt screams through the air in front of him, and destroys the railing on the far side of the deck. TYRION tries to continue towards the stern of the ship, but the dangerous bolts continue relentlessly, causing devastation and carnage. With no other options, TYRION jumps overboard to escape.

SOLDIER 4: Go! Go!

SOLDIER 5: Clear!

TYRION treads water. He looks up as a felled mast comes down on top of him. The screen goes black.

EXT: The shore of Blackwater Bay.

Unsullied drag their comrades through the surf and onto the shore. They cough and gasp. VARYS and TYRION lie on the shore, VARYS coughing uncontrollably. TYRION pants. GREY WORM staggers to the shore and desperately looks around.

GREY WORM: Missandei? Missandei!

GREY WORM runs back into the water, his eyes scanning for his love.

GREY WORM: Missandei!

He dives into the water and swims out to search for her.

INT: King's Landing, the Red Keep

CERSEI looks out into the courtyard of the Red Keep. A crowd files in through the main entrance from the city beyond.

CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then?

QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.

EURON approaches.

CERSEI: You're certain about the dragon?

EURION: I saw it sink beneath the waves.

CERSEI: That must have been glorious.

EURON kneels before her.

EURON: The glory is yours, my queen.

CERSEI strokes his face.

CERSEI: When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all.

EURON rises, and looks to QYBURN, who nods, confirming CERSEI's pregnancy. Elated, EURON stokes CERSEI affectionately. She does not enjoy it.

EURON: She's coming for you.

CERSEI: Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.

CERSEI moves away from the window and walks past the MOUNTAIN, who guards MISSANDEI, hands shackled and weeping.

CERSEI: So much for "the Breaker of Chains."

CERSEI, QYBURN and EURON exit.

INT: Dragonstone War Room

DAENERYS lays down the lion figure on the war map.

GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.

VARYS: Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.

DAENERYS: You saw my child fall from the sky.

VARYS: (nods)

DAENERYS: They took Missandei.

VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

DAENERYS: Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.

VARYS is silent.

TYRION: It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.

DAENERYS: Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.

DAENERYS and GREY WORM exit.

INT: Dragonstone Throne Room

VARYS: I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.

TYRION: She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?

VARYS: Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.

TYRION: And how do you know she wasn't?

VARYS: Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?

TYRION pours himself some wine.

TYRION: He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.

VARYS: Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?

TYRION: We're discussing treason.

VARYS: Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.

TYRION: Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.

VARYS: He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.

TYRION: Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.

VARYS: And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

TYRION: What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.

VARYS: She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.

TYRION: He could temper her worst impulses.

VARYS: As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

TYRION: How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.

VARYS: You've always known my reasons.

TYRION: At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.

VARYS: Even if you know it's a mistake?

TYRION: I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors.

VARYS: You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.

TYRION: What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.

VARYS: Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.

TYRION: So, what happens to her?

VARYS looks at TYRION with a knowing lock, not putting words to the unspeakable. TYRION shakes his head.

TYRION: Please. Don't.

VARYS: I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.

VARYS exits.

EXT: Winterfell courtyard

A man breaks coal in the busy courtyard. MAN 1: I'm just about to start it. WOMAN 1: Good luck. MAN 2: Protect shell right up to the wall. MAN 1: All right, I'll put another one on it. MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar. I'll need a cart over here. MAN 4: That's it, thanks. Thank you.

JAIME enters the courtyard. He looks over at SANSA, BRIENNE and MAESTER WOLKAN, who are engaged in conversation. WOLKAN exits one way and SANSA and BRIENNE leave in another. JAIME follows them. WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you. MAN 5: We need some more water. MAN 3: Take it down there!

CUT TO: Another part of the courtyard

JAIME finds SANSA talking to BRIENNE.

SANSA: . . . as are the rest of her advisors.

JAIME approaches them cautiously.

JAIME: What happened?

SANSA and BRIENNE exchange a glance. SANSA nods, giving BRIENNE permission to discuss it with JAIME.

BRIENNE: Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured.

SANSA: I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.

SANSA exits. JAIME's face falls.

INT: BRIENNE's chambers, night.

JAIME sits awake and and fully dressed at the foot of the bed. BRIENNE lies sleeping. He tries to slip away quietly, but the sound of his exit wakes BRIENNE. She sits up, alarmed, looking for him.

EXT: Winterfell courtyard, night

JAIME readies his horse for departure. BRIENNE approaches.

BRIENNE: They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.

JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?

BRIENNE takes JAIME's face in her hands, entreating him.

BRIENNE: You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.

JAIME: You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.

BRIENNE inhales deeply, holding back her tears.

JAIME: She's hateful. And so am I.

JAIME turns and mounts his horse. BRIENNE sobs. JAIME rides away, leaving her alone with her tears.

EXT: Outside King's Landing, day

VARYS, GREY WORM, DAENERYS and TYRION stand in front of the phalanx of Unsullied soldiers. High above them atop the gate, CERSEI, EURON and the MOUNTAIN look down upon them. MISSANDEI stands with them, bound and very scared. They are flanked by a long line of scorpions, loaded, manned and ready. The small company of Unsullied are vastly outnumbered by the archers and soldiers of King's Landing. An Unsullied solder shout and the company thump their spears to attention.

The gate rattles and QYBURN walks out. TYRION steps forward to meet him. They come together half way between the gate and the Unsullied.

QYBURN: My lord.

TYRION: Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.

QYBURN: Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.

TYRION: Qyburn, you're a rational man.

QYBURN: Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

TYRION: We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.

QYBURN: Yes.

TYRION: Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.

QYBURN: No, it is not a pleasant sound.

TYRION: I-- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.

QYBURN: My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.

TYRION: Your queen.

QYBURN: Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.

TYRION: Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.

QYBURN: We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--

Having heard enough, TYRION walks past QYBURN so that he can address CERSEI directly. As he approaches the wall, The Kingsguard respond to the thread.

CAPTAIN: Ready! Nock! Draw!

The scores of archers draw their bows back, aiming at TYRION. The Imp continues to approach until he is within shouting distance. Looking down on him with contempt, CERSEI raises her hand, ready to give the order to her soldiers. She makes a fist and brings her arm gently to her side. Her men stand down. TYRION nods, gratefully.

TYRION: I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

CERSEI weights his words. DAENERYS looks on, both anxious and angry. CERSEI steps forward next to MISSANDEI. In response, DAENERYS and GREY WORM move closer.

CERSEI: (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time.

MISSANDEI: Dracarys.

Horror and disbelief shows on the faces of DAENERYS and GREY WORM. TYRION mouths "No". CERSEI smiles cruelly. She looks to the MOUNTAIN, who steps forward, drawing his great sword. He sliced through MISSANDEI's neck in sweeping cut. Her head and body fall from the top of the gate to the ground below. GREY WORM turns away, unable to watch. His face twitches and be breathes raggedly.

Atop the wall, CERSEI looks down, satisfied. EURON looks pleased. TYRION turns around, dejected. He looks at DAENERYS, who struggles to contain her anger. She turns and walk away, though the Unsullied soldiers. TYRION knows he has failed her. CERSEI savors her cruel moment. DAENERYS fumes and boils with fury as she walks away.

CREDITS

INT: Dragonstone, VARYS's chambers

VARYS sits at an ornate desk, writing a letter about JON's true heritage. Only partially visible, it includes the phrases, "... is not the only Targaryen left, Rhaegar and Lyanna ..." and " ... their son lives still, hidden by Eddard Stark ... " and " ... he is the true heir to the Iron Throne ...". There is an knock on the door. VARYS discretely hides what he has been writing.

VARYS: Come in.

The door opens and MARTHA enters, sheepish.

VARYS: And?

MARTHA: (shakes her head)

VARYS: Nothing?

MARTHA: She won't eat.

VARYS taps the table rhythmically as he thinks.

VARYS: We'll try again at supper.

He returns to writing.

MARTHA: I think they're watching me.

VARYS: Who?

MARTHA: Her soldiers.

VARYS: Of course they are. That's their job.

VARYS extends his hand, kindly. MARTHA comes closer and clasps hold.

VARYS: What have I told you, Martha?

MARTHA: The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

VARYS: (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.

MARTHA exits.

EXT: Dragonstone shore, overlooking the beach

TYRION stands above the beach, watching a ship's boat being beached by its crew. JON walks from the boat to VARYS.

CUT TO: The Beach

VARYS: The Northern armies?

JON: Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?

JON and VARYS walk inland.

VARYS: She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.

JON: She shouldn't be alone.

VARYS: You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.

JON: Aren't you worried for her?

VARYS: I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.

JON: We're not much for riddles where I'm from.

VARYS: We both know what she's about to do.

They pause. JON sighs.

JON: That's her decision to make. She is our queen.

VARYS: Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.

JON: What do you want?

VARYS: All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.

JON considers.

JON: I don't want it. I never have.

VARYS: (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true: You will rule wisely and well, while she--

JON: She is my queen.

JON continues on, alone. VARYS sighs.

CUT TO: Above the beach

TYRION continues to watch JON and VARYS from above, his brow furrowed from concern and contemplation..

INT: Dragonstone war room

TYRION enters, stopping at the threshold.

TYRION: Your Grace?

DAENERYS does not reply. TYRION walks cautiously to DAENERYS, who stands, looking out at the shoreline.

TYRION: There's something you need to know.

DAENERYS: Someone has betrayed me.

Surprised, TYRION does not answer right away.

TYRION: Yes.

DAENERYS: Jon Snow.

TYRION: Varys.

DAENERYS: He knows the truth about Jon.

TYRION: He does.

DAENERYS: Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said he betrayed me.

TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.

DAENERYS: And Varys?

TYRION: Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.

DAENERYS: (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.

TYRION: It was a mistake.

DAENERYS: Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?

TYRION: She trusts me.

DAENERYS: Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.

TYRION: If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.

DAENERYS does not reply.

TYRION: But it doesn't matter now.

DAENERYS: No. It doesn't matter now.

TYRION takes measure of DAENERYS. She returns to her view of the landscape. She looks haggard and ill, more pale than ever with heavy bags under her eyes.

INT: Dragonstone, VARYS's chambers, night

VARYS sits writing by candlelight. In the distance, a door opens. VARYS looks up, and folds the scroll he was writing. He uses the candle in front of him to set it aflame, then snuffs the burning parchment. The sound of footsteps draw closer. VARYS removes his rings and places them in a small bowl. He sits, quietly resigned to his fate. The plodding of the approaching guards echos in the chamber. The door opens and GREY WORM enters, accompanied by a handful of Unsullied. He pauses and offers VARYS a menacing look.

CUT TO: The caves beneath Dragonstone.

GREY WORM and the Unsullied guards lead VARYS through the caverns by torchlight. They exit onto the rocky shore, passing an unhappy TYRION. DAENERYS stands in front of the surf, JON at her side. VARYS faces them, having accepted his fate. TYRION approaches from the side, and they exchange a knowing look.

TYRION: It was me.

VARYS: (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.

TYRION and VARYS take in their good-bye. TYRION touches his shackled hands, kindly, and steps away. VARYS fights to maintain his composure. DAENERYS steps forward.

DAENERYS: Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...

From behind her, Drogon's head emerges from the darkness, growling.

DAENERYS: ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.

Drogon rears up behind DAENERYS and roars. Fright takes over VARYS's face. Drogon steadies himself, roars between his teeth, and quickly unleashes an inferno that consumes VARYS. TYRION watches, deeply sorrowful. JON stands quietly, willing himself to follow his queen.

INT: Dragonstone map room, night.

DAENERYS sits by the fire, holding MISSANDEI's leather collar. GREY WORM stands at attention.

DAENERYS: This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.

DAENERYS hands the collar to GREY WORM. He looks it over, masking his pain, and then throws it in the fireplace, where it shrivels and burns. At the sound of footsteps, GREY WORM regains his composure and turns to face JON as he enters. DAENERYS hides her sorrow as well.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.

GREY WORM nods and exits. JON approaches DAENERYS. There is an awkward silence.

DAENERYS: What did I say would happen if you told your sister?

JON: I don't want it, and that's what I told him.

DAENERYS: She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.

JON: I love you. And you will always be my queen.

DAENERYS stands and walks close to JON.

DAENERYS: Is that all I am to you? Your queen?

They kiss, tentative at first, and then passion consumes them, until JON pulls away. He looks at her, deeply conflicted. DAENERYS shakes her head ever so slightly.

DAENERYS: All right, then.

DAENERYS takes a step back.

DAENERYS: Let it be fear.

INT: Dragonstone Throne Room, night.

DAENERYS sits on the throne. TYRION and GREY WORM stand on the main floor, looking up at her.

TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.

DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.

TYRION: They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.

DAENERYS: They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?

TYRION: What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.

DAENERYS: Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy IS: weakness.

TYRION: I beg you, my queen--

DAENERYS: But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.

TYRION is silent and disappointed in her decision.

DAENERYS: (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing - to join the Northern armies.

Desperate, TYRION ascends the platform stairs to get closer to DAENERYS.

TYRION: Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.

DAENERYS considers TYRION's suggestion. She nods quietly to GREY WORM, accepting the. Imp's plan.

DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.

GREY WORM nods and then exits. TYRION and DAENERYS look at one another silently. Then TYRION slowly bows every so slightly, expressing his gratitude to his Queen. He turns, and starts to walk away.

DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.

TYRION stops and turns.

DAENERYS: It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.

TYRION pivots and exits.

EXT: The streets of King's Landing, Day

The citizens of King's Landing chatter as they move into the protective walls of the Red Keep. They hold onto their loved ones and carry supplies on their backs or balanced on their heads. The guards help to keep them moving through the main entrance to the Keep.

GUARD 1: Let them pass.

GUARD 2: Through the gate.

GUARD 3: Get going.

EXT: The seas outside King's Landing.

JON and TYRION ride in a ship's boat. TYRION broods while JON is resigned. DAVOS waits for them on the shore below King's Landing, where their forces have made camp.

CUT TO: The encampment

The camp is busy as the forces prepare for the battle ahead. DAVOS, TYRION and JON pause a few yards from the shore.

DAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.

TYRION: She wants to attack now.

JON: Daybreak at the earliest.

JON turns to talk with some Stark soldiers.

SOLDIER 1: Careful with that.

SOLDIER 2: My lord.

DAVOS turns to leave as well, but TYRION stays him.

TYRION: Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?

DAVOS: I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

EXT: The encampment, night.

SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.

SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?

SOLDIER 1: Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.

The encampment has gone quiet for the night. Braziers light the camp at regular intervals. The HOUND and ARYA ride into camp. A SOLDIER stops them.

SOLDIER 3: Ay up. Where you going?

ARYA: I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

SOLDIER 3 is confused.

HOUND: Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.

SOLDIER 3: I need to go talk to my captain.

HOUND: Go ahead, talk to him.

ARYA and the HOUND continue on their way.

SOLDIER 1: Where's he going?

CUT TO: Another part of the camp.

TYRION walks past the Unsullied warriors who line the path. An UNSULLIED gives him a questioning look.

TYRION: (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.

The UNSULLIED is unresponsive.

TYRION: (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.

Again, the UNSULLIED makes no response. TYRION clears his throat and tries again.

TYRION: (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...

UNSULLIED: We speak the common tongue.

TYRION: Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.

UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.

TYRION: Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

UNSULLIED: No.

TYRION: Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.

The UNSULLIED looks to his comrades. They file away. TYRION enters the tent.

CUT TO: Inside the prisoner's tent.

JAIME sits, eyes closed, chained by his neck and hands. TYRION enters behind him,.

TYRION: How did they find you?

Without speaking or opening his eyes, JAIME simply holds up his golden right hand as explanation.

TYRION: Did you consider taking it off?

JAIME: Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."

TYRION: And you're going back to her, to die with her.

JAIME: You've underestimated her before.

TYRION: She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.

JAIME: Difficult to do from here.

TYRION holds up the key to JAIME's bonds. JAIME exhales heavily, impressed at this turn of events.

JAIME: When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?

TYRION: Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.

JAIME: To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.

TYRION: You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.

JAIME: The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.

TYRION: She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.

JAIME: Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.

TYRION: The city will fall tomorrow.

JAIME: She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company--

TYRION: I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.

JAIME: Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.

TYRION: Why?

TYRION moves closer to JAIME, and crouches to meet him, eye to eye.

TYRION: Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.

JAIME: Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war--

TYRION: There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.

JAIME considers.

TYRION: Swear to me.

JAIME: You have my word.

TYRION works to unlock JAIME's bonds.

TYRION: If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.

JAIME: I'll try.

TYRION: I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.

JAIME: Your queen will execute you for this.

TYRION: If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.

JAIME gives an apprehensive look. Offended, TYRION stands quickly

TYRION: Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.

JAIME: You would have.

TYRION: You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

JAIME starts to protest, but he is interrupted by TYRION's embrace. They hold one another. TYRION cries with an upwell of emotion. With a final look, TYRION exits quickly.

EXT: King's Landing, the next morning.

It is a quiet and beautiful morning. The Ironborn Fleet sits in the harbor, all sails furled. The scorpions are fully manned as they wait for the onslaught to commence. Euron strides to the foredeck of his ship while the soldiers behind him load the scorpion. His eyes scan the far distance, looking for a sign of enemy forces.

SOLDIER 1: Eyes on the horizon!

SOLDIER 2: Load the scorpion!

On another ship, Lannister soldiers load a massive bolt onto their scorpion.

CUT TO: The outer wall of Kings Landing

Lannister archers hustle into position. Below them, city dwellers run towards the Red Keep for protection. Scorpions line the walls of King's Landing, loaded and ready.

SOLDIER 3: Archers, close up!

MAN: Come on!

SOLDIER 4: Up to the espringal!

SOLDIER 5: To the back of it!

SOLDIER 6: Archers, line up!

CUT TO: The streets below

A stream of citizens rushes anxiously towards the Red Keep. Lannister soldiers march double time in the opposite direction.

WOMAN: This way! Come on!

SOLDIER 1: Clear the streets now!

Above the crowded street, citizen shutter their windows. Below people take shelter in their homes, one MAN grabbing his wife and picking up his child.

WOMAN: No!

MAN: In, now. And you, come on.

More citizens rush through the streets as others shutter their windows.

SOLDIER 2: Inside, now!

MAN 1: Quickly.

SOLDIER 2 directs the rushing citizens.

SOLDIER 2: Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

In a doorway, A woman soothes her infant as the crowd hurries past and her daughters carry their belongings inside.

FATHER: My son!

SOLDIER 1: Get inside!

CUT TO: Another street

ARYA and the HOUND walk calmly towards the Red Keep while anxious citizens stream around them. The HOUND wears a hooded cloak to disguise his face.

MAN 2: Just ahead of you, I can see it!

SOLDIER 1: All right, move it!

WOMAN: Come on!

SOLDIER 2: Keep moving!

SOLDIER 3: Keep going!

SOLDIER 2: Keep moving!

SOLDIER 3: Quickly!

SOLDIER 2: All the way!

MAN 1: Come on!

MAN 2: Come on!

FATHER: Hold your mother's hand!

Lannister soldiers move double time away from the Keep.

CUT TO: Another street.

JAIME, cloaked and inconspicuous, removes his glove from his golden hand. He looks around.

SOLDIER 4: Make way for the Golden Company!

JAIME slides through the gate, down the center of a Golden Company battalion as they march in time.

SOLDIER 4: Close the gate!

The gates close with a great clanging. JAIME continues to walk quietly towards the Keep.

CUT TO: Outside the walls of King's Landing.

The Golden Company stands at attention. Some of their faces betray their trepidation at the battle to come. HARRY STRICKLAND guides his mount in front of them. His eyes are fixed on the distance, where the Stark forces stretch across the panorama.

CUT TO: The Stark and Targaryen army

The battered and snarling Northmen are crowded together. Behind them, the Dothraki and the Unsullied stand ready. On a rise just behind them stands JON, DAVOS and GREY WORM. TYRION joins them as men file past. GREY WORM walks down the rise. They look at the battlements and forces in the near distance.

TYRION: If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.

JON looks at TYRION with apprehension. He exits, followed by DAVOS.

SOLDIER 1: Move along now, lads.

CUT TO: Inside the tower of the Red Keep.

CERSEI walks to the window and surveys the great capital city. In the far distance is the wall where her loyal forces are stationed, and the great plain beyond where the Stark and Targaryen forces await. Behind her, QYBURN and the MOUNTAIN stand ready.

CUT TO: The grounds of the Red Keep

Masses of city dwellers continue to move through courtyards, gates and walls to the protection of the Red Keep.

SOLDIER 2: That's it.

SOLDIER 3: Go on, move it.

SOLDIER 3: Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going.

SOLDIER 2: Keep moving.

The crowd chatters as they churn towards the gate. Among them, the HOUND becomes frustrated at the slow pace. He grabs NORA by the shoulder and brushes past her. ARYA returns her shock with a stare as she follows the HOUND through the gate.

HOUND: Move.

SOLDIER 2: Stay with him.

MAN: Hold on.

WOMAN: Hold my hand.

Seizing the opportunity, NORA instructs her daughter, VICKY, to follow behind the HOUND and ARYA.

NORA: Get behind there.

SOLDIER 1: Close the gate! No more through.

The HOUND picks up the pace to make it through before the gate seals. ARYA follows. People rush through, but the gate closes in front of NORA and VICKY.

NORA: No.

VICKY: No. Mommy.

NORA, VICKY and the others pound desperately on the massive doors.

NORA: Vicky! Please!

VICKY: No, please, sir!

MAN 1: Open the gate!

SOLDIER 1: Close the gate!

The massive crowd starts to panic, rushing towards to closed gate.

MAN 2: Open it!

MAN 3: Open the gate!

SOLDIER 2: Get back.

NORA points VICKY to sneak through the crowd towards another way into the Keep.

NORA: Look, try that one. Go. Go.

The crowd surges, crushing soldiers and citizens against the closed gate. The clamor rises and people become even more desperate. Far behind, the hooded JAIME sees that the gates are closed. He tries to jostle his way forward.

SOLDIER 3: The gates are locked now!

WOMAN: Open!

SOLDIER 3: Get back!

Trapped by the crowd and still far from the gate, JAIME rips off his hood. He waives his golden hand at the soldiers, hoping that they will recognize him.

WOMAN: Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!

MAN 4: Please open the gate!

SOLDIER 2: Go back to your homes!

SOLDIER 3: Stay back! It's closed!

JAIME: Soldier!

JAIME's cries are useless, lost in the din and chaos of the crowd.

SOLDIER 1: Move away! Stop!

MAN 5: Let us in!

JAIME gives up in frustration, he turns and fights through the crowd, away from this gate.

MAN 1: We're not leaving!

The crowd screams and shouts, growing larger by the minute. JAIME slips into any alleyway and runs.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

The shouts of the citizens have reached CERSEI's ears. She looks down, soberly.

CUT TO: The Stark and Targaryen forces.

TYRION surveys the two armies.

CUT TO: The outer wall

The Lannister soldiers scan the horizon.

CUT TO: The harbor.

EURON paces while his men look to the sky. Something in the sun catches his eye, and he shields his eyes as he looks directly at it. Drogon emerges from the blinding sun, diving through the sky towards the fleet. The Ironborn react to the attack.

SOLDIER: Turn!

They bring the scorpion around and fire a bolt at Drogon. DAENERYS and Drogon evade the bolt and continue their steep dive.

EURON has lost the dragon in the sun once again. Drogon soars above the fleet. With a roar, he levels his trajectory and lets forth an eruption of fire breath, decimating the boat in front of EURON as he flies past with unbelievable speed. He destroys another ship before arcing away for a second sortie.

EURON: Turn it around! - Turn it around!

Angry at the soldier's incompetence, EURON rushes to position the scorpion himself.

EURON: Get back! Back!

He is too late. Drogon destroys another handful of ships as he strafes the fleet.

EURON: Fire!

The scorpion fires at the banking Drogon, but misses. DAENERYS and Drogon come directly towards EURON's ship. The dragon belches forth fiery destruction, shattering EURON's ship as he leaps overboard to avoid incineration.

DAENERYS and Drogon lay waste to the fleet, then skate across the harbor towards the city itself. Atop the walls, the soldiers react, aiming their scorpions and the charging dragon.

SOLDIER 2: I can see her! Ready!

SOLDIER 3: Move!

SOLDIER 2: Fire!

They fire their bolt, but Drogon gracefully dodges, continuing to close the distance to the city wall at tremendous speed.

SOLDIER 2: Reload!

SOLDIER 3: Reload!

The soldiers strain to ready the weapon for another strike.

SOLDIER 2: Faster! Hurry!

The bolt locks in place. They start to aim the scorpion, but they are too late. Drogon swoops up, and engulfs them in a great burst of flame. Man and machine disintegrate in the powerful eruption.

SOLDIER 2: Fire!

Drogon spews forth more destruction. Soldiers scream in agony. DAENERYS and Drogon swoop past as man and machine and incinerate.

CUT TO: Outside the Walls of King's Landing

It is quiet. The two forces are still in their stand off. HARRY STRICKLAND is mounted before the Golden Company. GREYWORM, JON and DAVOS lead the Stark/Targaryen forces. Then GREY WORM takes one step forward, reacting to something no one else has sensed. A horse whinnies and the wind picks up, carrying the sound of great wings flapping. Everyone turns their heads, trying to locate the rising sound. STRICKLAND seems to hone in on the location, but too late. The gated wall behind the Golden Company explodes in an enormous fireball, disintegrating a huge section of the wall and consuming dozens of soldiers as it rages and spews forth. STRICKLAND is knocked from his horse by the blast as the Golden Company scatters and his mount expires. Drogon flies over the swath of destruction.

GREY WORM and the Unsullied charge, followed by the mounted Dothraki. Members of the Golden Company scream and writhe in agony as they burn. Stunned by the force of the blast, STRICKLAND pulls himself up on hands and knees. He sees the charging Dothraki army, and panics. He finds his feet and begins flees towards the wall, limping and bloodied. The Dothraki ride past, as he looks nervously to either side. He falls, impaled on GREY WORM's spear, revealing GREY WORM and the Unsullied following behind the Dothraki. GREY WORM pauses, steps on STRICKLAND's corpse and grunts as he frees his spear. Then he resumes to charge with the rest of the Unsullied.

Screamingly wildly, the Dothroaki gallop through the broken wall into King's Landing. Continuing full speed, they rip through the kingsguard just inside the walls, speeding through the street. The kingsguard fall like dominoes, no match for the ferocity of their charge. Behind the Dothraki, the Stark forces reach the wall, roaring as they enter the city. One soldier kneels by a severely burned member of the Golden Company who lies supine on the ground. He plunges his sword through the man's heart.

Above, Drogon flies along the wall and destroys another part of the battlement. The few kingsguards who survived the Dothraki rise to meet the Stark men in battle, but they are no match. Drogon continues to destroy the unwieldy scorpions before they can even threaten the dragon. The Stark men continue to dispatch the kingsguard who speckle the streets. Scores of kingsguards flee through an open yard, but Drogon catches up and destroys them with a mighty exhalation of fire. The die in a painful and brutal conflagration.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep.

CERSEI listens to the sounds of destruction, the rumbling explosions and the screeching roar of the distant dragon. A vast section of the outer wall burns as Drogon and DAENERYS fly toward another part of the city. Drogon unleashes his fire breath once again.

CUT TO: Inside the breached wall.

TYRION walks through the battlefield, stunned by the carnage. In the distance, more northern soldiers rush towards the battle.

MAN 1: Go!

MAN 2: Run!

Drogon strafes another row of scorpions, demolishing the ramparts where they are mounted.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

QYBURN passes the steadfast MOUNTAIN to approach CERSEI.

QYBURN: Your Grace.

CERSEI: All we need is one good shot.

QYBURN: The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.

CERSEI: The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.

QYBURN: Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning. The gates have been breached. The Golden Company--

CERSEI: Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.

QYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.

CERSEI: The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.

Drogon roars. QYBURN exits.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

GREY WORM leads JON, DAVOS and a force of northern soldiers and Unsullied warriors through the charred and burning wasteland. Bodies are strewn everywhere. A kingsguard tries to set upon GREY WORM, but the Unsullied captain gores him clean through with his spear. Other kingsguards make futile attacks, quickly dispatched by JON SNOW and his men. Before them, the streets are empty and clear.

CUT TO: The streets, a bit later.

JON, DAVOS and GREY WORM reach a crowd of Stark soldiers who are at a stand off with a perhaps one hundred kingsguard.

MAN 1: No, no, no!

JON: Move, move!

The Stark men part to let JON and his companions through so that he can lead face off with the kingsguard. JON, DAVOS and GREY WORM stop just in front of the Stark men. The two sides take measure of one another, separated by the width of a street.

CUT TO: Further back in King's Landing

TYRION passes through a burning internal wall, making his way among piles of charred bodies. Ahead of him some Unsullied warriors clear the streets. Beyond them in the near distance is a bell tower, and further back is the Red Keep. Smoke fills the air.

CUT TO: The alleys of King's Landing.

JAIME hies through the streets and alleys, passing citizens who have yet to take shelter.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI continues to survey the battle.

CUT TO: The streets

Citizens look up to see Drogon and DAENERYS diving towards them. Drogon roars and the panic begins. People scatter and run, desperate and terrified. Some protect their children while others knock down anyone in their way.

MAN: Run. Run! Come on!

Drogon roars and glides over a street filled with innocents fleeing. He lands atop a parapet and roars at the city dwellers who are trapped before him.

CUT TO: The standoff

JON and the leader of the kingsguard battalion stare at one another

CUT TO: The streets

Drogon, braces himself and lets out a mighty roar.

CUT TO: The standoff

The leader of the kingsguard hears the powerful roar. He seems to lose faith as he looks at the men around him. Then he drops in sword in surrender. The rest of the battalion follows. Then the message starts to be passed behind him, back towards the Red Keep.

SOLDIER 1: Ring the bells!

SOLDIER 2: Ring the bells!

MAN 1: The bells!

MAN 2: Ring the bells!

WOMAN: Ring the bells!

MAN 2: Ring the bloody bells!

MAN 3: Ring the bells!

WOMAN: Ring the bells!

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI stands at the window, listening to the cries of surrender from her citizens and soldiers.

WOMAN: Tell the queen to ring the bells.

MAN 4: Ring the bells! Ring the bell!

CUT TO: The alleys

JAIME picks up a sword from a pile of weapons as he passes by. He dodges as citizens flee, heading in the opposite direction.

WOMAN: This way.

JAIME ducks into a dark open doorway.

CUT TO: Tyrion in the streets

TYRION continues to look down the street at the bell tower and the Red Keep beyond.

SOLDIER: Ring the bell!

MAN 1: Ring the bell!

MAN 2: Ring them!

CUT TO: Atop the parapet

Drogon snarls as DAENERYS rides, listening to the calls from people below.

WOMAN: Ring the bells!

MAN 3: Ring the bells!

MAN 4: Ring the bells!

MAN 5: Help us!

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI listens to the cries from below, stone-faced. The MOUNTAIN continues to stand guard behind her.

MAN 6: In the name of the--

Drogon roars in the distance

MAN 7: Queen! We're surrounded!

CUT TO: Tyrion in the streets

TYRION waits for a reaction to the people's cries.

MAN: Ring the bells!

MAN 2: Now! Come on!

TYRION looks up to where Drogon and DAENERYS are perched on the parapet. The dragon snarls and roars.

CUT TO: Atop the parapet

DAENERYS does her best to control her rage as she waits.

MAN: Hurry up!

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI considers her options.

CUT TO: Atop the parapet

DAENERYS waits and listens. She is getting more anxious.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI listens, frozen in disbelief or denial.

WOMAN: Ring the bells!

The bell near the keep remains still.

CUT TO: TYRION in the streets

TYRION stares at the bell, pleading with his eyes. It sways and begins to ring.

CUT TO: The standoff

JON hears the one bell ringing. It is joint by another, and another still. He looks up and sighs in relief.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI slowly closes her eyes in defeat. Her face remains expressionless.

CUT TO: TYRION in the streets

TYRION looks over as Drogon roars. The bells become a chorus across King's Landing. His eyes are fixed on DAENERYS and her dragon as he waits for her to react.

CUT TO: Atop the parapet

DAENERYS sits atop Drogon, wide eyed and fighting a frantic energy. She breathes deeply and her face twists and boils with anger. She looks towards the Red Keep, where the Targaryens ruled. She thinks about all that she has suffered and endured. Bells clamor as the Iron Fleet burns in far distance. She tries to choke back her rage, but she cannot. She spurs Drogon to take flight. The dragon takes to the sky.

CUT TO: TYRION in the streets

TYRION is distraught as stares in disbelief at DAENERYS's response to the bells.

CUT TO: Above King's Landing

DAENERYS and Drogon fly directly towards the Red Keep. Drogon roars.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI watches Drogon and DAENERYS fly towards her.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

As Drogon flies overhead, the citizens and kingsguard run in panic. Behind some fleeing guards, Drogon unleashes his fire breath, decimating the buildings around them and then consuming the soldiers.

Just beyond, innocent citizen flee as quickly as they can. Drogon rises behind them, constantly spewing his deadly torrent of flame. Building collapse under the inferno, and the citizens disappear as the raging fire consumes them.

CUT TO: Tyrion in the streets

TYRION breathes shakily as he watches helplessly.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

The citizens flee, screaming and panting. Drogon's fire obliterates them.

CUT TO: The standoff

JON watches Drogon from afar. The kingsguards turn around at the sounds of destruction. GREY WORM breathes deeply, cold vengeance in his eyes. At the back of the kingsguard battalion, an eruption of Drogon's flame destroys a building and sends soldiers scattering. GREY WORM begins to lower his spear for attack. The leader of the King's guard spins quickly to face JON, betrayed in spite of his surrender. Before he can speak. GREY WORM changes his grip on his spear and hurls it through the man's chest. He falls, dead. JON's attention snaps to the ground in front of him. He hesitates. His men act FIRST: screaming a battle cry, they launch themselves at the kingsguard. JON is frozen in indecision as his men begin to decimate the kingsguard. Time slows down, and then JON comes to his senses. He grabs the man closest to him and pulls him back.

JON: No! Get back! Get back!

The northerners pour around him and JON manages to stop a handful. GREY WORM turns his head toward JON, staring with a look of fierce disapproval.

JON: Stay! Stay!

JON's efforts are fruitless. GREY WORM stares coldly at him. Then a kingsguard attacks JON, and he is forced into battle. GREY WORM turns to join they fray. JON defends and attacks. Further ahead GREY WORM methodically dispatches guard after guard with precision and artistry. The kingsguards are overwhelmed by the invading force. GREY WORM attacks with a brutality and rage, letting forth an uncharacteristic scream. His eyes are filled with hatred.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

Drogon and DAENERYS strafe another street, decimating kingsguards and buildings alike. The guards scream as they die painful deaths. Some citizens huddle for safety while others try to flee the path of destruction.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI watches as Drogon scorches greats swaths of King's Landing. Lines of fire scar the city and huge plumes of smoke rise beyond them.

CUT TO: TYRION in the streets

TYRION stands agog. Fleeing innocent citizens are incinerated.

CUT TO: The Unsullied and the Stark forces

The unsullied dispatch the wounded Kingsguard soldiers as they advance through the streets. Nearby, citizens stampede and scream in panic in panic. DAVOS tries to help direct them to safety.

DAVOS: Quickly. Quickly.

JON continues to try to stay his men from engaging in battle.

JON: Stop!

Guards attack JON, forcing him back into the melee. The Stark men are starting to attack the fleeing citizens as well as Kingsguards. The frenzy of the battle takes over as the seige becomes a sacking of the city. The Unsullied attack expertly and without mercy.

A little girl hide behind a pillar as others run. A Stark soldier tackles a citizen, and his wife leaps out to stop him.

SOLDIER: Get off me! Get off, bitch!

A Stark comrade pulls the woman off of the soldier and holds her back.

WOMAN: No, get off! Help! Help! No!

She screams and struggles, until he slits her throat. The little girl stands witness.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

Drogon lays waste to another street filled with innocents.

CUT TO: The Stark force.

JON shambles forward, helpless to stop the carnage. Some Kingsguard try to direct citizens out of harm's way.

KINGSGUARD: Go! Go!

JON's men continue to sack the city. He meet the attacks on him by reflex. He is overwhelmed by the wild carnage and is inability to stop it. He snaps to as one a Stark SOLDIER drags a WOMAN into an alley to rape her. The WOMAN falls to the ground and tries to crawl away. The SOLDIER continues his assault. Suddenly, JON grabs him from behind and pulls him, holding him against the wall with his left hand and brandishing his sword. The SOLDIER is surprised and confused. They exchange a look, then the SOLDIER looks at his prey and becomes defiant. JON runs him through, and the SOLDIER collapses to the ground.

JON: Find somewhere to hide.

The woman flees. JON reels and catches his breath.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

CERSEI watches as Drogon and DAENERYS strafe another section of King's Landing.

MAN: My God!

The mighty dragon flies directly towards the keep. Below, the citizens run in panic. Drogon sets onto the castle itself, destroying a small tower.

CUT TO: The shore beneath the Red Keep

JAIME has reached the mouth of the cave that leads into the Red Keep. A dinghy sits on the shore, just as TYRION directed. He starts into the cave, but is stopped by a voice behind him.

EURON: The Kingslayer.

An exhausted EURON wades onto the beach. The Iron Fleet burns in the distance beyond him. He spits out seawater.

JAIME: We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.

EURON: Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.

JAIME: Well, maybe for you.

JAIME starts to leave, but EURON draws his sword behind him.

EURON: If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.

JAIME: You're no king.

EURON: Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.

JAIME swings his sword wildly at EURION, who evades back, stumbling against a boulder behind him. JAIME brings down a powerful overhead swing that EURON dodges. Sword hits rock with a great clang.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

A piece of the ceiling falls, startling CERSEI. Drogon circles overhead. A great chunk of wall falls to the ground, crushing some unwitting citizens below. Drogon and DAENERYS circle the keep, then bring their full force upon it. Spiraling about the Red Keep, Drogon slices through walls and towers with his devastating fire breath. The mighty castle starts to come undone and crash to the ground.

CUT TO: The shore beneath the Red Keep

The broken tower slides down the cliffside and into the water just beyond the beach. JAIME runs further into the cave while EURON pursues him. JAIME swings his sword, but EURON jumps back and counters with his own attack, slicing the Kingslayer across the chest. JAMIE staggers against the rock. Pivoting, JAIME knocks away EURON's sword with a blow, and they begin to grapple. EURON elbows JAIME in the face, wraps him up and jerks him off balance. The Kingslayer loses his sword. Then EURON throws JAIME into the rock, and staggers to catch his breath. JAIME tackles him, but EURON managed to get astride JAIME delivers repeated blows to his face. JAIME coils his legs and kicks EURON in the throat. EURON falls to the ground, gagging for air. JAIME tries to land a great punch, but EURON avoids him, and grapples JAIME onto the wet sand. EURON chokes JAIME while JAIME tries to push him away. JAIME lands a two-handed blow to EURON's arms, head butts EURON, and tosses him aside. JAIME chokes up blood as EURON crawls towards his sword. JAIME grabs EURON's foot, and pulls him back. EURON kicks JAIME dives, and grabs his sword as JAIME grapples him. EURON pulls himself around and plunges his sword into JAIME's side. JAIME reels with pain. EURON grunts and pants, then he pulls his sword free from JAIME's torso. They both fall back. JAIME scuttles on his back, away from EURON, then rolls onto his back, gasping.

CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep

The entire city is aflame below CERSEI. Sounds of destruction fill the air. QYBURN enters.

QYBURN: Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.

CERSEI: The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.

QYBURN: The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.

CERSEI does not respond. A tear rolls down her face as her armor of denial comes down.

QYBURN: Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.

CERSEI weeps. She takes QYBURN's hand, and he leads her away. Below them, plumes of green wildfire explosions join the wholesale devastation of the capitol city. Dark and putrid smoke fills the sky.

CUT TO: The shore beneath the Red Keep

EURON pants in exhaustion. He is drenched in sweat and blood covers his mouth.

EURON: You fought well for a cripple.

JAIME wheezes, helpless. He looks down the beach. His sword is far from his grasp. He rolls onto his stomach and crawls towards it. EURON sees that there is still some fight in JAIME, and he drop his head, sighing. JAIME reaches his sword, but EURON stands above him, and he plunges his sword into JAIME's side once again. Both grunt, then JAIME pushes EURON onto the ground, and rights himself. He gores EURON through the stomach. They both yell. JAIME pushes his sword in further, pinning EURON against sand and rock. He steps back. EURON grabs the blade with both hands. Both pant and scream. JAIME forces the sword in further. Hate joins the pain on EURON's face.

EURON: Another king for you.

EURON grunts, then JAIME, pulls out his sword and stands over EURON. Blood pours from his stomach as EURON's head bows in relief. JAIME starts his way into the cave. EURON slides down the rock towards the sand. He twists his head to watch JAIME leave.

EURON: But I got you! {JAIME walks into the mouth of the cave and into the lit passage beyond.

EURON: I got you!

Panting, EURON smiles up to the sky.

EURON: I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

CUT TO: The map courtyard of the Red Keep.

Drogon and DAENERYS swoop overhead as the rumbles of destruction echo. The HOUND and ARYA enter the crumbing courtyard whose floor is a map of Westeros. They look up to the skies. Drogon roars.

HOUND: Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.

Drogon roars in the distance.

HOUND: Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.

ARYA: I'm going to kill her.

ARYA tries to walk past the HOUND, but he grabs her arm.

HOUND: You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.

ARYA jerks her arm free.

HOUND: It's all I care about. And look at me.

The HOUND grabs ARYA's should to force her to face him.

HOUND: Look at me! You wanna be like me?

The HOUND cups his hand around the back of ARYA's head.

HOUND: You come with me, you die here.

The HOUND walks away. ARYA pauses, then turns.

ARYA: Sandor.

The HOUND turns back around.

ARYA: Thank you.

With a knowing look, the HOUND exits the map courtyard and moves further into the keep. ARYA looks up as the walls continues to crumble around her. Drogon roars overhead. A great section of the ceiling collapses just behind them, revealing the ferocious glow of the fireball overhead. The tower shakes, and the party falls to their knees. The MOUNTAIN is felled by a chunk from the ceiling. Above them, the tower ceiling comes apart. The MOUNTAIN shield CERSEI with his body, taking great blows from the chunks that rain down upon them. CERSEI cowers. Drogon roars again, and the entire ceiling gives way, burying some of the kingsguards.

When then destruction settles, the MOUNTAIN stands erect. CERSEI and QYBURN are unharmed. There is nothing left of the tower behind THEM: only open sky, filled with smoke.

CUT TO: Red Keep spiral staircase

Full armored kingsguards flank CERSEI, QYBURN and the MOUNTAIN as they descend the grand staircase. Debris falls continuously as the tower above them crumbles. The HOUND enters below them. He nods at CERSEI.

HOUND: Your Grace.

The four remaining kingsguards rush down to engage the HOUND. He easily dispatches each of them in turn. He looks up to the MOUNTAIN.

HOUND: Hello, big brother.

The MOUNTAIN takes one step towards the HOUND.

CERSEI: Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

The MOUNTAIN pauses and looks back at CERSEI with his gruesome red eyes.. He takes another step.

CERSEI: Ser Gregor, I command you.

QYBURN: Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

QYBURN moves to intercept the MOUNTAIN. The hulk effortless picks QYBURN up by the neck and tosses him down the steps. QYBRUN's head smashes against the rubble strewn stairs when he lands, cracking his skull and killing him instantaneously. The MOUNTAIN takes a few more steps as CERSEI quivers behind him. Drogon roars. The Clegane brothers take measure of one another. CERSEI tentatively walks past the MOUNTAIN and then slides past the HOUND. She exits. More rubble falls as Drogon soars overhead, spewing fire.

The HOUND walks up the stairs towards the MOUNTAIN, then draws his sword and starts his attack. The MOUNTAIN fends of his blows with his armored arms, then grabs and stays the HOUND's blade. Enraged, the HOUND rips is weapon free and attacks anew. The MOUNTAIN parries with his arm. On his third blow, the HOUND knocks off the MOUNTAIN's helmet, revealing the ghoulish face of the revived corpse of his brother. His skin is fetid and rotting.

HOUND: Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.

The MOUNTAIN draws his sword. He unleashed powerful swings that crush the railing and wall when the HOUND dodges. Their swords clash with a powerful clang. The MOUNTAIN roars.

CUT TO: The Map Courtyard

The castle continues to fall around her as CERSEI makes her way through the Red Keep. Drogon roars overhead. An exhausted JAIME enters the courtyard behind her. She turns, and sees JAIME propping himself up against a pillar. Her face brightens with disbelief. She sobs and he walks to her. They embrace and hold on tight, panting. JAIME looks at her tears.

CERSEI: You're hurt.

JAIME: It doesn't matter.

CERSEI pulls her hands away. They are covered in JAIME's blood. JAIME caresses her face.

CERSEI: You're bleeding.

More of the Keep tumbles down. JAIME looks around for safe passage away from courtyard. They stagger together into the arcade.

CUT TO: The staircase.

The HOUND and the MOUNTAIN battle ferociously. The HOUND spins, traps the MOUNTAIN's arms between his body and his left arm, then leverages away the MOUNTAIN's sword. He steps back and plunges his sword into the MOUNTAIN's stomach, grunting with effort. He looks up with gritted teeth and forces the blade in further. The MOUNTAIN stands impassive, one hand cupping the blade. The HOUND cannot believe that the MOUNTAIN still stands. He roars and pushes the blade harder. The MOUNTAIN unleashes a mighty backhand that sends the HOUND tumbling backward down the steps. The HOUND struggles to look up. He watches the MOUNTAIN pull the blade from hit gut, his armor falling away. The MOUNTAIN descends towards the HOUND, who sighs in exasperation. The tower continues to collapse. The HOUND chuckles at the impossibility of it all. The MOUNTAIN grabs him by the collar, and flips him over, roughly.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA moves through the streets. Wounded denizens lean against the wall, screaming. Debris falls are fires burn. ARYA switches directions and walks through the chaos. People yell and scream.

OWEN: Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?

OWEN grabs ARYA, frantic.

ARYA: Let go.

OWEN: Have you seen my wife?

OWEN lets go and rushes off. ARYA continues. A child wails as others cry out in pain. ARYA ducks away from the falling stone as people rush past her.

MAN: Out of the way!

Flapping can be heard overhead. ARYA quickens her pace, and collides with a man wearing a turban. Drogon roars. ARYA and the man push past one another, with ARYA heading down a darken staircase. She emerges in a scene of carnage, the wounded and burned huddled and hiding. Women wail, holding their mortally wounded loved ones. Drogon's flaps his wings above them. ARYA flees. The man in front of her is felled by debris.

MAN: No!

Drogon roars and flies over them, his mouth erupting in flame. ARYA jostles through the alley and into a flood of people running in panic. She gets pulled into the screaming mob. She looks behind her to scan the skies, but she loses her footing and falls under the rushing crowd.

CUT TO: The stairs

The HOUND falls to the ground, grunting.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA tries to get up as people rush past.

CUT TO: The stairs

HOUND: Oh.

The HOUND tries to get up. The MOUNTAIN grabs him by the collar

CUT TO: The streets

The crowd pushes ARYA down as they run over her.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN throws the HOUND against the ruined wall. The HOUND grunts and falls

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA continues to struggle.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN throws the HOUND once again.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA struggles and panics.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN holds the HOUND against the wall by the throat. The HOUND punches his brother in the jaw. The MOUNTAIN responds with a more powerful blow to the HOUND's jaw. The HOUND collapses to the ground.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA struggles and panics.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN unleashes on the HOUND. He picks the nearly unconscious HOUND up by the shirt and hits him again.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA struggles to get up.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN pulls the HOUND up by the shirt and brings him up to his knees. The HOUND groans. The MOUNTAIN lands a powerful downward punch to the HOUND's face.

CUT TO: The streets

ARYA covers her head for protection. She has given up on trying to stand. A helping hand appear.

NORA: Take my hand. Take my hand. Get up. Get up.

NORA helps ARYA to her feet. VICKY is by her side. Drogon roars overhead. Everyone ducks as Drogon flies past. The buildings around them start to collapse. People start to scatter. ARYA and NORA get torn from one another, swept up in the crowds.

NORA: No. No.

ARYA: Wait! Wait! No!

ARYA looks back, searching for NORA, but it is futile. She starts to run with the crowd. Buildings around them continue to collapse.

CUT TO: The stairs

The MOUNTAIN throws the HOUND to the ground again. The HOUND groans. The MOUNTAIN picks up his brother by the neck and chokes him, slamming him against the wall. The HOUND gurgles, exhausted and desperate for air. Gagging, the HOUND tries to gain purchase on the MOUNTAIN's hands. He shakes and writhes as the MOUNTAIN pins him to the wall. The HOUND frees his dagger from his belt and stabs the MOUNTAIN just above the clavicle. The MOUNTAIN doesn't react. The HOUND stabs again grunting. He then stabs the MOUNTAIN repeatedly in the torso.

HOUND: Fucking die!

The HOUND stabs the MOUNTAIN below the neck once more. The HOUND laughs and chokes at the impossibility of the MOUNTAIN's stamina. The MOUNTAIN moves his thumbs atop the HOUND's eyes, presses his hands like a vice around the HOUND's head and raises his brother high in the air. He presses his thumbs into the HOUND's eye sockets. The HOUND lets out short screams, his feet dangling helplessly. He blindly palpates the MOUNTAIN's face, then plunges his dagger deep into the MOUNTAIN's face, the blade penetrating clean through to the other side. The MOUNTAIN steps backward and the HOUND collapses onto the floor. The MOUNTAIN staggers backward, confused and blinded. The HOUND coughs and sits upright. The HOUND growls at his brother and pants. The MOUNTAIN regains his composure and slowly reaches for the hilt of the knife. The HOUND watches in disbelief. The MOUNTAIN starts to tug at the dagger. Screaming, the HOUND launches himself at his brother. Just as the MOUNTAIN frees the dagger from his face, the HOUND tackles him. They crash through the compromised wall behind them. They fall amidst an avalanche of stone down to the raging fire far below. They disappear into the conflagration.

CUT TO: The Stark soldiers

The Stark men yell as the kingsguards while the denizens of King's Landing are caught in between. Behind JON, a building explodes from wildfire, then more still. The acrid green explosions speckle the burning city. Drogon flies in the distance. JON and DAVOS have had enough. JON sheaths his sword.

JON: We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!

SOLDIER 1: Fall back!

JON grabs a Stark soldier by the collar and forces him to join in the retreat from the explosions. The Stark men obey JON's order. He tries to command the citizens as well. One man is buried in a burning avalanche of debris.

JON: Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

The Stark men begin to run. Drogon flies overhead, strafing another street with flame.

SOLDIER 1: Fall back!

The soldiers and the civilians flee while Drogon soars overhead.

CUT TO: ARYA in the streets

ARYA lies unconscious on the ground, covered in a think layer of ash. Blood from a head wound coats her cheek and has soaked into her tunic. She is awoken by an explosion nearby. She gasps and coughs. People shout in the distance. She pulls herself to her feet as people run past. She staggers and coughs, then stops to clear her lungs. Above her, the stone cracks in the high tower next to her, and begins its collapse. ARYA runs in terror as others around her scream and flee. Great fragments fall around her, shaking the ground as they impact. ARYA is surrounded by dust.

The air clears, and ARYA sits against a wall, panting. She calms herself and looks at the citizens who have also taken shelter here. She moves over to them and takes the hand of the cowering NORA.

ARYA: You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.

WOMAN 2: We can't go out there.

ARYA: You have to.

WOMAN 2: Everyone out there is dead.

ARYA: If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me.

ARYA pulls up NORA and VICKY.

ARYA: Follow me!

Others follow them out into the street. Other denizens rush past.

MAN 1: Come on, quickly. All of you.

Dothraki riders appear, and slaughter then men. ARYA leads NORA and VICKY down the street, running. The Dothraki ride past. ARYA is separates from NORA as they dive to opposite sides of the street to avoid a pair of galloping Dothraki.

A woman screams behind her. ARYA scampers back to NORA and VICKY.

GIRL: Mama! Mama! Mama!

ARYA gets to her feet and reaches the NORA and VICKY. NORA lies on the ground.

VICKY: No. Mama! Mama! Mama!

Drogon roars behind them. ARYA helps NORA to her feet. She is in great pain.

ARYA: Get up. Get up!

NORA yells in pain and ARYA grunts as they get her to her feet, her arm draped over ARYA's shoulder. They begin to limp down the street as others run and scatter. Drogon flies behind them.

ARYA: We have to keep moving.

NORA: Take her. Take her!

NORA falls to her knees. ARYA grabs VICKY and pulls her away from her NORA.

NORA: Take her.

ARYA: Come on! Come on!

VICKY fights ARYA and wrestles free. She runs back to her NORA. Drogon floats towards them, and lets forth a burst of flame. ARYA dives into an alley as the NORA and VICKY are incinerated amongst the screams.

CUT TO: Dragon skull cellar

JAIME and CERSEI enter the Red Keep cellar where the dragon skulls are stored. Sounds of destruction echo.

JAIME: This way.

The tunnel JAIME wanted has collapsed and is impassable. He looks for another way. CERSEI watches him.

CERSEI: I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.

JAIME returns to her.

CERSEI: Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die.

JAIME embraces CERSEI. She weeps. Part of the cavern collapses.

JAIME: It's all right.

CERSEI: Please don't let me die.

JAIME: It's all right.

CERSEI: I don't want to die.

JAIME: Just look-- Look at me. Look at me.

CERSEI: Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.

JAIME: Look-- Look-- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look-- Look at me! Just look at me.

CERSEI looks at him. She fights back her tears.

JAIME: Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.

They caress one another. CERSEI focuses on JAIME. He nods in encouragement. They gather in a tight embrace. Behind them, the cavern begins its final collapse. The ceiling gives way in a wave of destruction that envelopes them, and they are gone.

CUT TO: The streets of King's Landing

It is quiet. Smoke and huge flakes of ash waft though the air. ARYA sits quivering beside a blackened wall. She stands, shakily, and starts putting one foot in front of the other. She walks through the decimates streets. Fires burn everywhere. The street is littered with blackened bodies. ARYA sees the corpses of NORA and VICKY, embracing in death. She looks down the street, and sees a white horse, improbable as it is. She approaches slowly and gently takes its reins. She calms the horse.

CUT TO: Another street

ARYA rides the galloping horse down the length of the street, fires burning on each side.

CREDITS

EXT: The ruins of King's Landing

TYRION walks silently through the smoldering desolation of King's Landing as soldiers mill in the distance. Everything is covered in filthy soot, and small fires continue to burn in the ruin. His eyes looks skyward as his memories replay. Flakes of ash drift in the air. He passes piles of brick and broken beams, and small fires speckle the devastation. He passes the prone body of a blond girl, the first of many charred and incinerated corpses. He does not pause.

A man comes towards TYRION, shambling in a state of shock. His bare chest is streaked with soot, and his pants are in tatters. TYRION looks back as he passes. The whole of the man's back is burned away severely. TYRION continues forward, with JON and DAVOS trailing behind him. TYRION chokes down his rage as he walks. The bodies here have been reduced to skeletons, even those who were hiding indoors.

TYRION, JON and DAVOS pause at mangled body of a Kingsguard.

TYRION: I'll find you later.

JON: It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.

TYRION: I'm going alone.

TYRION walks forward, alone. He turns a corner and pauses to take in the Red Keep, and continues onward.

EXT: The streets of King's Landing

Unsullied soldiers stand at attention behind a line of kneeling Kingsguard prisoners. GREY WORM paces in front of them.

GREY WORM: In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.

JON: Grey Worm!

JON and DAVOS enter, along with their men. JON comes face-to-face with GREY WORM.

JON: It's over.

GREY WORM: These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.

DAVOS: How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.

GREY WORM: They are breathing.

DAVOS: Look around you, friend. We won.

GREY WORM: I obey my queen's commands, not yours.

JON: And what are the queen's commands?

GREY WORM: "Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister." These are free men. They chose to fight for her.

GREY WORM draws his dagger, but JON grabs hold of his arm to stay him. As one, the Unsullied lower their spears and step into battle stance. The Stark soldiers respond by drawing their weapons to defend their King.

DAVOS: Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

GREY WORM and JON continue to stare each other down.

DAVOS: Jon. We should speak with the queen.

The tension is broken, and JON looks down. Accepting DAVOS's council, he releases GREY WORM's arm. They begin to walk away and the Unsullied return to attention. GREY WORM slits the throat of the first Kingsguard, The guard grunts softly as GREY WORM pushes him forward to die. JON and DAVOS exit.

EXT: The Red Keep

TYRION walks under the arcade leading to the map courtyard of the Red Keep. A great crack runs the length of the Westeros map, and piles of debris cover both sides of the broken floor. Ash flakes fall like snow. TYRION enters the chamber at the far side. He picks up a metal torch from the floor and continues further into the castle.

INT: The Red Keep Cellar

TYRION moves by torchlight down a circular stairway leading below the Keep. He reaches the bottom, and his eyes search the cavernous room. Archways are filled with rubble, impassable. TYRION spies a crack of light in one archway. He places the torch on the ground.

INT: The Dragon Skull Chamber

TYRION enters the cellar chamber containing the dragon skulls. He climbs a pile of rubble and comes upon JAIME's golden hand, half buried amongst the bricks. TYRION kneels, then bows as he touches the hand in grief. As he straightens, he takes away a single heavy brick and tosses it aside. He moves a second brick and then a third. JAIME's body starts to become visible. TRYION begins to weep, painfully. He fights back the tears, and begins to work again. After a few bricks, his sobs overtake him. Still mostly buried corpses, JAIME lays holding CERSEI. TYRION bawls, and smashes a brick repeatedly in frustration. He props himself up to look at his siblings. He sobs again.

EXT: Streets of King's Landing.

ARYA walks through the streets, taking in the piles of debris and bodies. She is soot covered, he face bloody and filthy. Nearby, the Dothraki shout. She looks beyond the arches where the mounted Dothraki forces have amassed.

Amongst the Dothraki, JON strides forward. They are still filled with battle lust, and their horses are antsy for action. After passing through the wild Dothraki, JON reaches the phalanx of disciplined Unsullied. He continues forward to a great staircase leading to a ruined structure. An expansive Targaryan flag hangs over the left side of the ruined facade.

CUT TO: The adjacent arcade

Further back, ARYA also walks forward, staying under the arcade to the left of the riled Dothraki.

CUT TO: The steps

JON reaches the foot of the staircase, lined by Unsullied on each side. He ascends towards GREY WORM above. A dragon roars in the distance. JON takes a deep breath as he looks up at GREY WORM at the top of the stairs. Drogon roars again. As the dragon files over the Dothraki, they cheer wildly. Drogon glides over the ruined facade. JON renews his ascent.

JON reaches the top of the stairs. DAENERYS walks stoically from within the ruin of the building. Drogon roars and unfurls behind her. His wings appearing to expand from her soldiers, making her the image of a true dragon queen. Drogon then launches into the air. DAENERYS reaches the grand terrace, its staircase flanked by the disciplined Unsullied. She surveys the devastation of King's Landing, which continues to burn and smolder as far as the eye can see. JON walks to the wings as she takes her place in the center of the terrace, looking out over the ranks of the Unsullied, and the shouting Dothraki horde behind them. DAENERYS breathes deeply as she takes in her triumph, her destiny.

CUT TO: The courtyard.

The Unsullied stand at rigid attention. The controlled stillness of the Unsullied provides stark contrast to the wild Dothraoki ululations behind them.

The Dothraki, still mounted continue to celebrate in their visceral fashion. They waive their raises swords and cheer wildly. Their horses churn amongst themselves, feeding on the energy of their riders.

CUT TO: The terrace.

DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.

The Dothraki horde quiets and looks up to their khaleesi.

DAENERYS: You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.

The Dothraki cheer.

DAENERYS: Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.

Drogon lands on a ruined building to her left, and lets out a screeching roar. The Dothraki return the cheer, and resume their wild cries of celebration, waiving their weapons once again. From DAENERYS"s left, JON looks on with concern. DAENERYS surveys her forces with pride and satisfaction. She turns to speak to GREY WORM.

DAENERYS: Torgo Nudho.

GREY WORM steps forward from her right.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.

The Unsullied thump their spears in a unison of slow triplets. GREY WORM steps back. From behind the terrace, TYRION approaches, his face a mask of malice.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!

The Unsullied thump their spears.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!

The Unsullied thump their spears as DAENERYS continues her speech. JON and TYRION watch her, stone faced and roiling.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.

Drogon roars and the Unsullied thump in threes.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?

Drogon answers with a roar. The Unsullied answer by thumping their spears rhythmically. Behind them, ARYA looks on with disgust.

DAENERYS savors the moment. The Unsullied thump. Drogon roards. The Dothraki go wild, horses rearing.

TYRION takes a deep breath, passes JON and approaches DAENERYS cautiously from behind. He stands to her left to take in the scene. DAENERYS looks at him, satisfied. DROGON roars. The celebrations continue, spears thumping in rhythm and Dothraki screaming amok.

DAENERYS: You freed your brother. You committed treason.

TYRION: I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.

They face one another. TYRION devastated and DAENERYS haughty. They lock eyes. TYRION removes his Queen's Hand brooch. He tosses it away in disgust. The brooch bounces half way down the steps, landing at the feet of an Unsullied warrior. The celebrations come to a quiet. DAENERYS and TYRION continue to take measure of one another. DAENERYS makes her decision.

DAENERYS: (In Valyrian) Take him.

Two Unsullied step forward and flank TYRION. The dwarf accepts his fate, turns his back to the courtyard, and walks slowly away. The Unsullied pivot and walks beside him. TYRION gives JON a look that demands that JON come to his own reckoning of DAENERYS's slaughter of King's Landing. JON's sorrowful visage is weighed by the gravity of the situation. He watches GREY WORM lead TYRION away. JON turns back to look at DAENERYS. She is both transcendent and horrible. She sees JON's inner conflict, and chooses to let him think. She walks away from the courtyard, her Unsullied falling in line behind her. JON watches her go.

JON steps into the courtyard behind the terrace and looks on as DAENERYS continues to walk on. He suddenly notices that ARYA has appeared silently at his side.

JON: What are you doing here?

Gathering himself, JON notices the cuts and wounds across ARYA's face. He takes hold of her.

JON: Hey, what happened?

ARYA: I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.

JON: (sighs) She's everyone's queen now.

They watch DAENERYS walk away with her Unsullied.

ARYA: Try telling Sansa.

JON: Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.

JON starts to leave, but ARYA grabs his arm to halt him.

ARYA: Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.

INT: King's Landing Cellar

JON descends a staircase, followed by an Unsullied warrior. He looks at the two Unsullied guards at the foot of the staircase, then hands Longclaw back to his minder. He strides past the Unsullied.

INT: Tyrion's makeshift cell.

An Unsullied warrior opens the door for JON, who walks past him into a large, darkened storeroom strewn with cabinets, tables, pots and crates. The door shuts behind JON as he comes upon TYRION who sits on the floor, back against a small wooden pen.

TYRION: Did you bring any wine?

JON: No.

TYRION: Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ASHES: "See, I told you." It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.

JON: (sighs)

TYRION: So is there life after death?

JON: Not that I've seen.

TYRION: I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.

JON: You didn't.

TYRION: I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.

JON: I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.

TYRION: Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?

TYRION stands and approaches JON.

TYRION: She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.

JON: And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.

TYRION: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

JON: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

TYRION: My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.

JON: Cersei left her no choice.

TYRION: The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.

JON: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

TYRION: And she burned down a city for it.

JON: Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.

TYRION: Would you have done it?

JON: What?

TYRION: You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?

JON: I don't know.

TYRION: (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.

JON: What's it matter what I'd do?

TYRION: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.

JON: (sighs)

TYRION: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?

JON sits, overwhelmed, and inhales deeply. TYRION walks closer to him.

TYRION: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.

JON: "Love is the death of duty."

TYRION: You just came up with that?

JON: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

TYRION: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?

JON weighs TYRION's words, somber and distraught.

TYRION: It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

JON exhales shakily. Then he stands, regaining his composure.

JON: That's her decision. She is the queen.

JON pats TYRION's shoulder, and rests his hand there.

JON: I'm sorry it came to this.

JON walks back to the door and knocks to call the guards.

TYRION: And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?

JON: My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

TYRION: Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

JON: She doesn't get to choose.

TYRION: No. But you do. And you have to choose now.

Keys rattle outside the door and it swings open. The guard stands at attention. JON ponders, then leaves quickly. The Unsullied guard shuts the door.

EXT: King's Landing arcade.

JON strides the length of an arcade that is lined by Unsullied soldiers.

EXT: King's Landing courtyard.

JON walks in the snowy courtyard. The piles of rubble are covered by a layer of snow. More snow falls from the grey and blustery sky. He looks up at the Red Keep as he walks, approaching a passageway that leads to the Keep. As he approaches the passage, the large pile before him cracks, then undulates and expands. It is Drogon, wakened from slumber. The blanket of snow that enveloped him falls away. The dragon growls and extends himself to smell JON, who stands motionless before the great beast. Drogon growls softly, and curls back around himself, accepting JON's presence. JON walks past him and into the dark passage.

INT: The Throne Room

DAENERYS walks out of the darkness, into the half-demolished throne room. The Iron Throne sits untouched, surrounded by dust and snow. Open sky extends beyond it, where the wall of the Keep once stood. The wind blows and snow falls directly into the room. DAENERYS pauses, then walks to the throne, past the twisted and broken waste. She touches the hilt of one of the countless swords that have been forged into the throne. With a faint smile, DAENERYS takes in the enormity of the completion of her life's quest. She turns and looks back across the length of the hall.

JON emerges from the same entryway that DAENERYS used. He walks towards her. She descends the steps to meet him, happy to share her victory with him.

DAENERYS: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.

JON: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.

DAENERYS takes on a defensive demeanor in response to JON's anger.

DAENERYS: It was necessary.

JON: Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!

DAENERYS: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.

JON: And Tyrion?

DAENERYS: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?

JON: Forgive him.

DAENERYS: I can't.

JON: You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.

DAENERYS does not respond.

JON: Please, Dany.

DAENERYS: We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.

JON: The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.

DAENERYS comes closer, hopeful and bright.

DAENERYS: And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.

JON: How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?

DAENERYS: Because I know what is good. And so do you.

JON: I don't.

DAENERYS: You do. You do. You've always known.

JON: What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.

DAENERYS: They don't get to choose.

DAENERYS embraces JON.

DAENERYS: Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20. We do it together. We break the wheel together.

JON: You are my queen. Now, and always.

They kiss, passionately. JON's right arm thrusts as they kiss. He grunts as his blade pierces DAENERYS through the heart. Their lips part. Panting, DAENERYS looks down at the blade in her torso, then up into JON's eyes. They both pant and gasp. DAENERYS falls back, JON holding her up with both arms. Her eyes glaze in pain and disbelief. She takes shallow, panting breaths as small rivulets of blood run from her mouth and nose. She dies. JON exhales sharply and begins to weep.

JON cradles her dead body. In the distance, DROGON screeches. The dragon past, then circles back to the throne room. Drogon roars and growls as he scrambles slowly towards JON and DAENERYS. He sniffs, confused and curious. JON tenderly lays DAENERYS down onto the snow-covered floor and continues his half-embrace as he takes her in.

Behind him, Drogon, pushes forward, growling. JON stands and faces the dragon. He steps carefully back to make room. Drogon nuzzles DAENERYS and coos. When she doesn't move, he nuzzles more firmly with his chin. Recognizing she is dead, Drogon gives a short, piercing whistle, then looks directly at JON. A rumbling growl builds as Drogon bares his teeth at JON. He rears back, screeching and whistling, then turns to the sky for a deafening roar. He spreads his wings, balancing on his haunches, roaring and roaring. He brings his forearms down, and looks directly down at JON. He roars and his throat glows as the fire builds in his belly. JON prepares for his immolation.

Drogon lets loose his inferno, extending his neck so that the flames surge past JON's head burn the castle walls around the Iron Throne. Drogon stops, takes a deep breath, then blasts the Iron Throne with an unyielding conflagration. The mighty throne slowly gives way as Drogon spews fire and roars. The sword tips melt and bend. The throne becomes a glowing, amorphous slag under the relentless flames. It spills and melts away in a molten, flaming heap.

Drogon stops his assault. JON looks at the oozing, burning slag in amazement. Behind him, Drogon nuzzles DAENERYS again. Then the dragon grabs her gently in his hind claw. He takes to the sky, launching over the remains of the Iron Throne. He gives a final roar, and flies gently away.

INT: Tyrion's Makeshift Cell.

TYRION lies silently on the floor, eyes open, hands shackled. Footsteps approach and the door rattles open. GREY WORM enters, flanked by two Unsullied.

EXT: An arcade

TYRION walks with his hands chained. GREY WORM leads him to the Dragon Pit, with four unsullied marching behind them.

EXT; The Dragon Pit

GREY WORM and TYRION reach the entrance to the Dragon Pit. The pass the Unsullied footmen who stand at attention. The large awning tent stands in the center of the pit, with many people seated underneath. GREY WORM and TYRION approach the central dais. Seated there are SAM, a RIVERLANDS LORD, and EDMURE, then ARYA, BRAN and SANSA, then BRIENNE, DAVOS, GENDRY and a VALE LORD, then an IRONBORN LORD, YARA and a DORNISH PRINCE and finally ROBIN ARRYN, MAESTER WOLKAN and YOHN ROYCE. TYRION glowers at them, meets their eyes, and looks down in shame. GREY WORM stands with disciplined posture at his side.

SANSA: Where's Jon?

GREY WORM: He is our prisoner.

SANSA: So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.

GREY WORM: We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.

SANSA: If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.

GREY WORM: And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.

YARA: Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

SANSA: You swore to follow a tyrant.

YARA: She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.

ARYA: Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.

DAVOS stands.

DAVOS: Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?

GREY WORM does not respond.

DAVOS: If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.

GREY WORM: We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.

DAVOS sits.

TYRION: It's not for you to decide.

GREY WORM: You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.

TYRION: (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.

MAESTER WOLKAN: We don't have a king or queen.

TYRION: You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.

TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who shakes his head dismissively.

GREY WORM: Make your choice, then.

Those on the dais exchange glances. EDMURE seizes the moment. He stands and moves towards the center of the dais.

EDMURE: My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst--

SANSA: Uncle? Please sit.

EDMURE scoffs and looks around for support. He only finds muted laughter and averted gazes as he engages ROBIN, YOHN ROYCE, MAESTER WOLKAN and SAM. He turns to SANSA, whose eyes instruct him to take his seat. Humiliated, Edmure turns and stumbles as his sword crashes into the post at his side. He sits, then sighs.

MAESTER WOLKAN: Well, we have to choose someone.

SAM clears his throat to get everyone's attention.

SAM: Why just us?

SAM stands.

SAM: Um-- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.

Those gather ponder SAM's suggestion. YOHN ROYCE bursts out laughing, and others follow.

EDMURE: Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.

YOHN ROYCE: I'll ask my horse.

SAM nods uncomfortably at their rejection, then sits.

EDMURE: I suppose you want the crown.

TYRION: Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her. Can't think of a worse choice.

DAVOS: Who, then?

TYRION: I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.

TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who rebuffs him.

TYRION: What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?

SANSA: Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.

TYRION: Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.

TYRION looks at GREY WORM again. This time, he holds the Imp's gaze.

TYRION: From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.

TYRION walks to BRAN.

TYRION: I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?

BRAN: Why do you think I came all this way?

TYRION: To Brandon of House Stark I say aye.

They consider

SAM: Aye.

TYRION nods in return.

EDMURE: Aye.

RIVERLANDS LORD: Aye.

YOHN ROYCE: Aye.

TYRION turns to YOHN ROYCE, who nods in approval.

MAESTER WOLKAN: Aye.

ROBIN: Aye.

DORNISH PRINCE: Aye.

YARA: Aye.

IRONBORN LORD: Aye.

VALE LORD: Aye.

GENDRY: Aye.

DAVOS: I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

BRIENNE: Aye.

SANSA turns to BRAN.

SANSA: I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.

BRAN nods, accepting SANSA's terms.

TYRION: All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Everyone stands (except BRAN).

ALL: All hail Bran the Broken!

They sit. TYRION bows to BRAN and turns to leave.

BRAN: Lord Tyrion you will be my Hand.

TYRION: N-- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

BRAN: And I don't want to be king.

TYRION: I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.

BRAN: I choose you.

GREY WORM: You cannot.

BRAN: Yes, I can. I'm king.

GREY WORM: This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.

BRAN: He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.

GREY WORM: It is not enough.

INT: JON's makeshift cell.

TYRION councils JON in his cell.

TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.

JON: There's still a Night's Watch?

TYRION: The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.

JON: (sighs)

TYRION: You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.

JON: Was it right? What I did?

TYRION: What we did.

JON: It doesn't feel right.

TYRION: Ask me again in 10 years.

TYRION approaches JON, and rests his hand on JON's shoulder. He starts to walk away.

JON: I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.

TYRION: I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.

JON: (nods)

TYRION exits.

EXT: King's Landing seaward stairs.

JON descends the stairs. The surf roars and seagulls call. Two men of the Night's Watch await him at the bottom of the stairs. They follow him as he continues towards the water. The bay is filled with ships.

CUT TO: the wharfs

JON walks through the busy wharf. He looks up to see GREY WORM in the ship that he is passing. They take measure of one another, then JON looks down and continues on. An UNSULLIED CAPTAIN joins GREY WORM

UNSULLIED CAPTAIN: (in Valyrian) All the men have boarded.

GREY WORM: (in Valyrian) Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.

The UNSULLIED CAPTAIN nods and exits. The Unsullied prepare their ship for embarkment.

CUT TO: King's Landing sea walk.

JON walks along the sea wall. SANSA, ARYA and BRAN are waiting for him.

SANSA: I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?

JON struggles to find any words.

JON: The North is free, thanks to you.

SANSA: But they lost their king.

JON: Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.

SANSA gives JON a tearful hug. He holds her close. JON then places his hand on ARYA's shoulder.

JON: You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.

ARYA: I can't.

JON: You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?

ARYA: (chuckles) I'm not going back north.

SANSA: Where are you going?

ARYA: What's west of Westeros?

JON: (chuckles) I don't know.

ARYA: No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.

JON and ARYA trade nods.

JON: You have your Needle?

ARYA: Right here.

JON and ARYA embrace, tearfully. JON then kneels before BRAN.

JON: Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.

BRAN: You were exactly where you were supposed to be.

JON rises and sighs. He gives a last look at his three siblings, and walks to the ship's boat filled with night's watchmen.

INT: King's Landing library

BRIENNE sits in the library, paging through the history of the knights of Westeros. She comes to the page for Ser Jaime Lannister. It is only half written, and somewhat sloppily done. She fills his pages in careful script. She has to think about how to end the entry. Her final written line is "Died protecting his Queen." She closes the massive tome.

INT: Small Council Chamber.

TYRION enters first, and looks at the chair inscribed for the hand. He sits down and sighs. He gets up quickly to straighten the other chairs at the table to make the room more presentable. The door opens, and he sits back down at the head of the table. BRONN, DAVOS and SAM (dressed in Maester's garb) enter. BRONN and DAVOS noisily and uncouthly take their seats. TYRION quietly emits some futile protests.

TYRION: That's not-- Uh--

SAM places a large book in front of TYRION.

TYRION: What's this?

SAM: A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.

TYRION starts to flip through the pages.

TYRION: I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.

SAM: Oh, I wouldn't say that.

TYRION: Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed.

SAM does not respond.

TYRION: He's not kind?

SAM: He -

TYRION: He what? What does he say about me?

SAM: I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

TYRION cannot believe it. BRONN smirks. TYRION pushes the book aside as the door opens. They stand as BRAN enters, his chair pushed by BRIENNE, now captain of the Kingsguard.

TYRION: Your Grace.

DAVOS: Your Grace.

BRONN: Your Grace.

SAM: Your Grace.

BRIENNE places BRAN at the other head of the table. TYRION sits, and the others follow his lead. They look to BRAN.

BRAN: We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.

TYRION: Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.

BRAN: And Drogon? Any word?

SAM: He was last spotted flying east, toward--

BRONN: The farther away, the better.

BRAN: Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.

TYRION: As you wish, Your Grace.

BRIENNE: Ser Podrick.

PODRICK enters, also a kingsguard. The small council stands.

TYRION: (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.

SAM: Long may he reign.

DAVOS: Long may he reign.

BRIENNE: Long may he reign.

BRONN: Long may he reign.

PODRICK wheels BRAN around.

TYRION: That will improve.

BRAN: (smiling) I'm sure it will.

BRAN and PODRICK exit. Everyone sits back down.

TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?

BRONN: In full, my lord Hand.

TYRION: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?

BRONN: Indeed we can.

TYRION: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.

DAVOS: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.

BRONN: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.

DAVOS: "Any more."

BRONN: You Master of Grammar now too?

SAM: Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.

SAM: The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out--

BRONN: The strong live and the weak don't.

TYRION: Find the best builders and set them to the task.

BRONN: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.

SAM: Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.

BRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.

BRIENNE: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.

BRONN: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

TYRION: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.

EXT: Castle Black.

The wind whistles on a grey day at the wall. A horn sounds as JON and two night's watchmen arrive on horseback. The doors are opened for them. Jon breathes deeply, gathering his emotional strength. In the courtyard, TORMUND stands, resting. JON spurs his mount forward. The gate closes behind him.

INT: ARYA's ship

ARYA picks up needle from the table.

CUT TO: Winterfell

Sansa's war garb is fitted on a tailor's dummy. Handmaidens adjust the heavy grey gown that she wears for her corontation.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA sheaths needle.

CUT TO: Winterfell

Handmaidens continue to dress SANSA. Her sleeves feature embroidered autumn leaves.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA rolls her pack and unrolls a map. She collapses a spy glass and exits her quarters.

CUT TO: Winterfell

SANSA walks along the snowy covered walkway and then through a torchlit hallway, towards a stairwell.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA walks through a ship's darkened passageway, then up the steps that lead to the deck.

CUT TO: Castle Black

JON walks slowly to look out over the crowd of night's watchmen and free folk that have gathered in the snowy courtyard. He turns back without speaking.

CUT TO: Winterfell

SANSA enters the crowded great hall. As she walks past, everyone kneels before her.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA walks through along the ship's deck as the crew works.

CUT TO: Castle Black

JON walks through the crowd of free folk and night's watchmen.

CUT TO: Winterfell

SANSA progresses though the hall and her people kneel.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA walks and the crew works efficiently. The ship sails at a steady clip.

CUT TO: Castle Black

JON makes his way through the ragtag crowd of wildling women, children, and men. They part to make way for him. Ghost whines, and JON smiles. The direwolf is missing an ear, and has other cuts and abrasions. JON kneels down to pet him. Ghost licks him in return.

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA stands just behind the wolf figurehead of her ship. She looks out at the unknown seas ahead, and she smiles.

CUT TO: Castle Black

JON and TORMUND are mounted behind the gate that leads from Castle Black to the tunnel through the Wall. The Gate rises before them.

CUT TO: Winterfell

Someone places a braided crown onto SANSA's head. She surveys her subjects and takes a seat at her throne. Her soldiers draw their swords and salute her.

MAN: The Queen in the North!

ALL: The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!

CUT TO: ARYA's ship

ARYA stands at the prow and the ship sails away, to the west. Her sails display the Stark wolf.

CUT TO: Castle Black

JON rides through the tunnel, with TORMUND behind him. Ghost reaches the other side of the wall first. The free folk follow behind them. The move out into the snowy expanse. The freefolk chatter happily as they walk. JON looks back as the external gate closes. They reach the first expanse of woods, and continue northward.
