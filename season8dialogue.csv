0,ep_1,TYRION, You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.,12
1,ep_1,VARYS," You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?",15
2,ep_1,TYRION," Because I have balls, and you don't.",7
3,ep_1,JON, I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,8
4,ep_1,JON, Look at you.,3
5,ep_1,JON, You're a man.,3
6,ep_1,BRAN, Almost.,1
7,ep_1,JON, Where's Arya?,2
8,ep_1,SANSA, Lurking somewhere.,2
9,ep_1,JON," Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.",13
10,ep_1,DAENERYS," Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.",22
11,ep_1,SANSA," Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.",5
12,ep_1,BRAN, We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.,13
13,ep_1,BRAN," He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.",13
14,ep_1,SANSA," As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?",27
15,ep_1,UMBER," We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.",11
16,ep_1,UMBER, And my lord.,3
17,ep_1,UMBER, And my queen. Sorry.,4
18,ep_1,SANSA, You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.,18
19,ep_1,JON, We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.,24
20,ep_1,LYANNA, But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.,21
21,ep_1,LYANNA, A lord? Nothing at all?,5
22,ep_1,JON, It's not important.,3
23,ep_1,LYANNA, Not important? We named you King in the North.,9
24,ep_1,MAN, King of the North!,4
25,ep_1,JON," You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.",58
26,ep_1,TYRION," If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.",59
27,ep_1,TYRION," I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.",20
28,ep_1,SANSA," May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?",41
29,ep_1,DAENERYS, Whatever they want.,3
30,ep_1,GENDRY," Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.",10
31,ep_1,GENDRY, Are these the last of the wagons?,7
32,ep_1,TYRION, My lord. My lady.,4
33,ep_1,ROYCE, My lady.,2
34,ep_1,TYRION, The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.,10
35,ep_1,SANSA," So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.",12
36,ep_1,TYRION, Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.,10
37,ep_1,SANSA, It had its moments.,4
38,ep_1,SANSA, Apologies for leaving like that.,5
39,ep_1,TYRION," Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.",17
40,ep_1,SANSA, We both survived.,3
41,ep_1,TYRION, Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.,9
42,ep_1,TYRION," I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-",36
43,ep_1,SANSA, Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?,12
44,ep_1,TYRION, She did.,2
45,ep_1,SANSA, And you believed her?,4
46,ep_1,TYRION, She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.,13
47,ep_1,SANSA, I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.,10
48,ep_1,JON, How did you sneak up on me?,7
49,ep_1,ARYA, How did you survive a knife through the heart?,9
50,ep_1,JON, I didn't.,2
51,ep_1,JON, You still have it.,4
52,ep_1,ARYA, Needle.,1
53,ep_1,JON, Have you ever used it?,5
54,ep_1,ARYA, Once or twice.,3
55,ep_1,ARYA, Valyrian steel.,2
56,ep_1,JON, Jealous?,1
57,ep_1,ARYA, Too heavy for me.,4
58,ep_1,JON, Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.,11
59,ep_1,ARYA," She doesn't like your queen, does she?",7
60,ep_1,JON, Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.,6
61,ep_1,ARYA, She's the smartest person I've ever met.,7
62,ep_1,JON, Now you're defending her?,4
63,ep_1,JON, You?,1
64,ep_1,ARYA, I'm defending our family. So is she.,7
65,ep_1,JON, Yeah. I'm her family too.,5
66,ep_1,ARYA, Don't forget that.,3
67,ep_1,QYBURN," Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.",15
68,ep_1,CERSEI, Good.,1
69,ep_1,YARA, Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?,11
70,ep_1,EURON, But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.,16
71,ep_1,EURON, If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?,10
72,ep_1,EURON, I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.,12
73,ep_1,YARA, Are we in King's Landing?,5
74,ep_1,EURON, Mm.,1
75,ep_1,YARA, You picked the losing side.,5
76,ep_1,EURON, Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.,8
77,ep_1,EURON, But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.,7
78,ep_1,CERSEI," Twenty-thousand men, is it?",4
79,ep_1,HARRY," Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.",8
80,ep_1,EURON, They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.,18
81,ep_1,CERSEI, Horses?,1
82,ep_1,HARRY, Two thousand.,2
83,ep_1,CERSEI, And elephants?,2
84,ep_1,HARRY," Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.",5
85,ep_1,CERSEI, That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.,10
86,ep_1,HARRY," They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.",13
87,ep_1,CERSEI," In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.",13
88,ep_1,HARRY," We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.",10
89,ep_1,EURON, Am I most welcome here?,5
90,ep_1,CERSEI, You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.,12
91,ep_1,EURON, Good. As a true friend and an honored guest,9
92,ep_1,EURON, I was hoping we could talk in private.,8
93,ep_1,CERSEI, After the war. That was our agreement.,7
94,ep_1,EURON, Wars sometimes last years.,4
95,ep_1,CERSEI," You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.",12
96,ep_1,EURON, How?,1
97,ep_1,EURON," I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.",23
98,ep_1,CERSEI, You're insolent. I've executed men for less.,7
99,ep_1,EURON, They were lesser men.,4
100,ep_1,DIRAH, I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.,10
101,ep_1,CRAYAH, Burnt up some of my favorite boys.,7
102,ep_1,DIRAH," Archie, was it?",3
103,ep_1,CRAYAH, And William.,2
104,ep_1,DIRAH, Tall handsome William?,3
105,ep_1,CRAYAH," Yeah, tall handsome William.",4
106,ep_1,DIRAH, They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.,12
107,ep_1,BRONN, I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.,12
108,ep_1,CRAYAH, Did you?,2
109,ep_1,BRONN, Nearly killed it.,3
110,ep_1,MAREI, That's brave.,2
111,ep_1,CRAYAH, That boy Eddie.,3
112,ep_1,DIRAH, The ginger?,2
113,ep_1,CRAYAH, That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.,15
114,ep_1,DIRAH, How does he sleep with no eyelids?,7
115,ep_1,BRONN," All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?",11
116,ep_1,BRONN, You're kidding me.,3
117,ep_1,QYBURN," Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.",12
118,ep_1,BRONN," Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.",5
119,ep_1,CRAYAH, You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.,10
120,ep_1,QYBURN, Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.,10
121,ep_1,BRONN, Which girl?,2
122,ep_1,QYBURN, The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.,17
123,ep_1,BRONN," She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.",16
124,ep_1,QYBURN," That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.",33
125,ep_1,BRONN," So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-",19
126,ep_1,QYBURN, She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.,8
127,ep_1,BRONN," Yeah, well, good luck with that.",6
128,ep_1,QYBURN, Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-,17
129,ep_1,QYBURN, She has a keen sense of poetic justice.,8
130,ep_1,BRONN, That fucking family.,3
131,ep_1,QYBURN," When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?",39
132,ep_1,CERSEI, I wanted those elephants.,4
133,ep_1,EURON," So, how do I compare to the fat king?",9
134,ep_1,CERSEI, You're insulting my late husband?,5
135,ep_1,EURON, Are you offended?,3
136,ep_1,CERSEI," Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.",18
137,ep_1,EURON, And the Kingslayer?,3
138,ep_1,CERSEI," You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?",7
139,ep_1,EURON, Life is boring.,3
140,ep_1,CERSEI," You're not boring, I'll give you that.",7
141,ep_1,EURON, Do I please the queen?,5
142,ep_1,CERSEI, You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.,13
143,ep_1,CERSEI, But now I want to be alone.,7
144,ep_1,EURON, I'm going to put a prince in your belly.,9
145,ep_1,YARA, We can take our home back.,6
146,ep_1,THEON, Daenerys went north.,3
147,ep_1,YARA, Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.,17
148,ep_1,THEON, You're my queen. I go where you command.,8
149,ep_1,YARA, You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.,18
150,ep_1,THEON, What is dead may never die.,6
151,ep_1,YARA, But kill the bastards anyway.,5
152,ep_1,WOLKAN," Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me",8
153,ep_1,VARYS, The Karstarks.,2
154,ep_1,TYRION," One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.",9
155,ep_1,DAVOS, Can't argue with that.,4
156,ep_1,DAVOS," Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.",23
157,ep_1,TYRION, And our queen is grateful.,5
158,ep_1,DAVOS," Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.",52
159,ep_1,TYRION, I sense that you're leading to a proposal.,8
160,ep_1,DAVOS," A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?",38
161,ep_1,TYRION, They do make a handsome couple.,6
162,ep_1,VARYS, You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.,15
163,ep_1,TYRION, I'm not that old.,4
164,ep_1,TYRION, Not as old as him.,5
165,ep_1,TYRION, Our queen respects the wisdom of age.,7
166,ep_1,VARYS," Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.",23
167,ep_1,TYRION, What is that?,3
168,ep_1,VARYS, Nothing lasts.,2
169,ep_1,DAENERYS, Your sister doesn't like me.,5
170,ep_1,JON," She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.",21
171,ep_1,DAENERYS, She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-,17
172,ep_1,DAENERYS, The dragons are barely eating.,5
173,ep_1,JON, What's wrong with them?,4
174,ep_1,DAENERYS, They don't like the North.,5
175,ep_1,DAENERYS, Go on.,2
176,ep_1,JON, I don't know how to ride a dragon.,8
177,ep_1,DAENERYS, Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.,7
178,ep_1,JON, What if he doesn't want me to?,7
179,ep_1,DAENERYS," Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.",7
180,ep_1,JON, What do I hold onto?,5
181,ep_1,DAENERYS, Whatever you can.,3
182,ep_1,JON, You've completely ruined horses for me.,6
183,ep_1,DAENERYS, We could stay a thousand years-,6
184,ep_1,DAENERYS, No one would find us.,5
185,ep_1,JON, We'd be pretty old.,4
186,ep_1,JON, It's cold up here for a southern girl.,8
187,ep_1,DAENERYS, So keep your queen warm.,5
188,ep_1,DAENERYS, Don't be afraid.,3
189,ep_1,GENDRY, It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.,10
190,ep_1,SANDOR," You're saying you're good, is that it?",7
191,ep_1,GENDRY, I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-,8
192,ep_1,SANDOR, You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?,15
193,ep_1,SANDOR, I heard you were here. You left me to die.,10
194,ep_1,ARYA, First I robbed you.,4
195,ep_1,SANDOR," You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.",13
196,ep_1,ARYA, That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.,12
197,ep_1,GENDRY," Yeah, thanks. So have you.",5
198,ep_1,GENDRY," I mean, you look good.",5
199,ep_1,ARYA, Thanks. So do you.,4
200,ep_1,GENDRY," It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.",13
201,ep_1,ARYA," Stay close to that forge, then.",6
202,ep_1,GENDRY," Is that a command, Lady Stark?",6
203,ep_1,ARYA, Don't call me that.,4
204,ep_1,GENDRY," As you wish, milady.",4
205,ep_1,ARYA, Here's my wish.,3
206,ep_1,ARYA, Can you make it?,4
207,ep_1,GENDRY, What do you need something like this for?,8
208,ep_1,ARYA, Can you make it or not?,6
209,ep_1,GENDRY, You already have a sword. What's that?,7
210,ep_1,GENDRY, It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.,12
211,ep_1,ARYA, You don't know any other rich girls.,7
212,ep_1,SANSA, Come in.,2
213,ep_1,SANSA," Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.",15
214,ep_1,JON," ""House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?",19
215,ep_1,SANSA," ""I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said.",8
216,ep_1,SANSA," ""The King in the North.""",5
217,ep_1,JON, I told you we needed allies.,6
218,ep_1,SANSA, You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.,11
219,ep_1,JON," I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.",22
220,ep_1,SANSA, And a Targaryen queen.,4
221,ep_1,JON," Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",40
222,ep_1,JON, Do you have any faith in me at all?,9
223,ep_1,SANSA, You know I do.,4
224,ep_1,JON, She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.,13
225,ep_1,SANSA," No, she's much prettier.",4
226,ep_1,SANSA, Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?,14
227,ep_1,SAMWELL, Oh!,1
228,ep_1,DAENERYS, So you're the man?,4
229,ep_1,SAMWELL," Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?",7
230,ep_1,DAENERYS, The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.,11
231,ep_1,JORAH," They could, they just wouldn't.",5
232,ep_1,DAENERYS, I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.,21
233,ep_1,SAMWELL," Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.",9
234,ep_1,DAENERYS," Well, there must be something I could give you.",9
235,ep_1,SAMWELL," If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.",11
236,ep_1,DAENERYS, For what crime?,3
237,ep_1,SAMWELL," Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.",9
238,ep_1,SAMWELL, And also a sword.,4
239,ep_1,DAENERYS, From the Citadel?,3
240,ep_1,SAMWELL, From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.,10
241,ep_1,SAMWELL," It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.",12
242,ep_1,DAENERYS, Not Randyll Tarly?,3
243,ep_1,SAMWELL, You know him?,3
244,ep_1,DAENERYS, I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.,17
245,ep_1,SAMWELL," Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.",14
246,ep_1,DAENERYS, Your brother stood with your father.,6
247,ep_1,SAMWELL," Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- May I?",12
248,ep_1,DAENERYS, Of course.,2
249,ep_1,SAMWELL, What are you doing out here?,6
250,ep_1,BRAN," Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.",12
251,ep_1,SAMWELL," No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?",9
252,ep_1,BRAN, I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.,13
253,ep_1,JON, Sam?,1
254,ep_1,SAMWELL," I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.",11
255,ep_1,JON, Were you hiding from me?,5
256,ep_1,SAMWELL, Of course not.,3
257,ep_1,JON, What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?,16
258,ep_1,JON, What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?,7
259,ep_1,SAMWELL, She's good.,2
260,ep_1,JON, Little Sam?,2
261,ep_1,SAMWELL, Don't you know?,3
262,ep_1,JON, Know what?,2
263,ep_1,SAMWELL, Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.,11
264,ep_1,SAMWELL, She didn't tell you.,4
265,ep_1,JON, I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.,9
266,ep_1,SAMWELL, Would you have done it?,5
267,ep_1,JON," Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.",7
268,ep_1,SAMWELL, You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.,12
269,ep_1,JON, I wasn't a king.,4
270,ep_1,SAMWELL, But you were. You've always been.,6
271,ep_1,JON," I gave up my crown, Sam.",6
272,ep_1,JON, I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.,11
273,ep_1,SAMWELL, I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.,19
274,ep_1,SAMWELL, Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.,17
275,ep_1,JON, What are you talking about?,5
276,ep_1,SAMWELL, Your mother was Lyanna Stark.,5
277,ep_1,SAMWELL," And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.",33
278,ep_1,JON, My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.,19
279,ep_1,SAMWELL," No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.",42
280,ep_1,JON, Daenerys is our queen.,4
281,ep_1,SAMWELL, She shouldn't be.,3
282,ep_1,JON, That's treason.,2
283,ep_1,SAMWELL, It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?,17
284,ep_1,EDD," Stay back, he's got blue eyes!",6
285,ep_1,TORMUND, I've always had blue eyes!,5
286,ep_1,BERIC, Did you find anyone?,4
287,ep_1,EDD, The Umber boy.,3
288,ep_1,BERIC, It's a message. From the Night King.,7
289,ep_1,TORMUND, His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.,9
290,ep_1,EDD, We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.,13
291,ep_1,TORMUND," If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.",10
292,ep_1,TORMUND, We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-,11
293,ep_2,DAENERYS, Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.,26
294,ep_2,DAENERYS, He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.,30
295,ep_2,DAENERYS, Your sister pledged to send her army north.,8
296,ep_2,JAIME, She did.,2
297,ep_2,DAENERYS," I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.",19
298,ep_2,JAIME, She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.,16
299,ep_2,JAIME," She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.",33
300,ep_2,DAENERYS," ""We""?",1
301,ep_2,JAIME, I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.,13
302,ep_2,TYRION," Your Grace, I know my brother-",6
303,ep_2,DAENERYS, Like you knew your sister?,5
304,ep_2,TYRION," He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?",22
305,ep_2,DAENERYS," Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.",18
306,ep_2,SANSA," You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.",28
307,ep_2,JAIME," Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.",28
308,ep_2,BRAN, The things we do for love.,6
309,ep_2,DAENERYS, So why have you abandoned your house and family now?,10
310,ep_2,JAIME, Because this goes beyond loyalty.,5
311,ep_2,JAIME, This is about survival.,4
312,ep_2,BRIENNE," You don't know me well, Your Grace.",7
313,ep_2,BRIENNE," But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.",45
314,ep_2,BRIENNE," Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.",32
315,ep_2,SANSA, You vouch for him?,4
316,ep_2,BRIENNE, I do.,2
317,ep_2,SANSA, You would fight beside him?,5
318,ep_2,BRIENNE, I would.,2
319,ep_2,SANSA," I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.",17
320,ep_2,DAENERYS, What does the Warden of the North say about it?,10
321,ep_2,JON, We need every man we can get.,7
322,ep_2,DAENERYS, Very well.,2
323,ep_2,JAIME," Thank you, Your Grace.",4
324,ep_2,DAENERYS," Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.",26
325,ep_2,TYRION, I was a fool.,4
326,ep_2,DAENERYS, Not for the first time.,5
327,ep_2,DAENERYS," Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.",20
328,ep_2,TYRION, I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.,13
329,ep_2,GENDRY, Don't you have something better to do?,7
330,ep_2,ARYA, You make my weapon yet?,5
331,ep_2,GENDRY, Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.,12
332,ep_2,ARYA, You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.,12
333,ep_2,GENDRY, It's strong enough.,3
334,ep_2,GENDRY," It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.",11
335,ep_2,ARYA, Are you going to be down in the crypt?,9
336,ep_2,GENDRY," No, but-",2
337,ep_2,ARYA, But you're a fighter.,4
338,ep_2,GENDRY, I've done my share.,4
339,ep_2,ARYA, You've fought them?,3
340,ep_2,GENDRY, I did. Some of them.,5
341,ep_2,ARYA, How many?,2
342,ep_2,GENDRY, A few. That was enough.,5
343,ep_2,ARYA, What are they like?,4
344,ep_2,GENDRY, Bad. Really bad.,3
345,ep_2,ARYA," ""Really bad""?",2
346,ep_2,ARYA," Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?",30
347,ep_2,GENDRY," Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-This is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.",36
348,ep_2,ARYA, I know Death.,3
349,ep_2,ARYA, He's got many faces.,4
350,ep_2,ARYA, I look forward to seeing this one.,7
351,ep_2,ARYA, My weapon?,2
352,ep_2,GENDRY, I'll get right on it.,5
353,ep_2,JAIME, I'm sorry for what I did to you.,8
354,ep_2,BRAN, You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.,9
355,ep_2,JAIME, I'm not that person anymore.,5
356,ep_2,BRAN," You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.",20
357,ep_2,JAIME, You're not?,2
358,ep_2,BRAN, No. I'm something else now.,5
359,ep_2,JAIME, You're not angry at me.,5
360,ep_2,BRAN, I'm not angry at anyone.,5
361,ep_2,JAIME, Why didn't you tell them?,5
362,ep_2,BRAN, You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.,17
363,ep_2,JAIME, What about afterwards?,3
364,ep_2,BRAN, How do you know there is an afterwards?,8
365,ep_2,TYRION," Well, here we are.",4
366,ep_2,JAIME," Yes, here we are.",4
367,ep_2,TYRION, Together again.,2
368,ep_2,TYRION, And the masses rejoice.,4
369,ep_2,JAIME, How do they feel about their new queen?,8
370,ep_2,TYRION, She's your new queen too.,5
371,ep_2,TYRION, They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.,20
372,ep_2,JAIME, And she is? Different?,4
373,ep_2,TYRION, She is.,2
374,ep_2,JAIME, You're sure about her?,4
375,ep_2,TYRION, I am.,2
376,ep_2,JAIME, She didn't seem sure about you.,6
377,ep_2,TYRION, It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.,17
378,ep_2,JAIME, Hmm.,1
379,ep_2,TYRION, Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.,20
380,ep_2,TYRION, Was she lying about the baby too?,7
381,ep_2,JAIME," No, that part is real.",5
382,ep_2,JAIME, She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.,24
383,ep_2,JAIME, What?,1
384,ep_2,TYRION," She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.",16
385,ep_2,TYRION," So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-",33
387,ep_2,JAIME, Your cock.,2
388,ep_2,TYRION, My cock.,2
389,ep_2,TYRION, At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.,26
390,ep_2,TYRION, Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.,14
391,ep_2,BRIENNE, Ser Jaime.,2
392,ep_2,JAIME, Lady Brienne.,2
393,ep_2,JAIME, He's come a long way.,5
394,ep_2,BRIENNE, He's all right. Still has a lot to learn.,9
395,ep_2,JAIME, I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.,13
396,ep_2,BRIENNE," I am. It's, uh-It's good ground.",6
397,ep_2,JAIME, It is.,2
398,ep_2,BRIENNE," The rise, it should give us some advantage.",8
399,ep_2,BRIENNE," If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.",15
400,ep_2,JAIME," Yes, I think you're right.",5
401,ep_2,BRIENNE, What are you doing?,4
402,ep_2,JAIME, What?,1
403,ep_2,BRIENNE, I think you know.,4
404,ep_2,JAIME, I truly don't.,3
405,ep_2,BRIENNE, We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.,15
406,ep_2,JAIME, You want me to insult you?,6
407,ep_2,BRIENNE, No!,1
408,ep_2,JAIME, Good.,1
409,ep_2,JAIME," I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.",25
410,ep_2,BRIENNE, I better get back.,4
411,ep_2,JORAH," Forgive me, khaleesi.",3
412,ep_2,DAENERYS, Have you done something to offend me?,7
413,ep_2,JORAH, Many things.,2
414,ep_2,DAENERYS, Long ago and long forgiven.,5
415,ep_2,JORAH," But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.",19
416,ep_2,DAENERYS," When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.",14
417,ep_2,JORAH, You made the right choice.,5
418,ep_2,DAENERYS, I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.,10
419,ep_2,JORAH, I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.,24
420,ep_2,JORAH, But the mind behind all those words-,7
421,ep_2,DAENERYS, He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.,5
422,ep_2,JORAH, As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.,11
423,ep_2,DAENERYS, You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?,11
424,ep_2,JORAH," I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.",10
425,ep_2,ROYCE," The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.",17
426,ep_2,SANSA, Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.,18
427,ep_2,DAENERYS," Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.",9
428,ep_2,DAENERYS, I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.,15
429,ep_2,SANSA," Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.",13
430,ep_2,DAENERYS, I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.,12
431,ep_2,SANSA, Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.,13
432,ep_2,DAENERYS, I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.,13
433,ep_2,DAENERYS," I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.",26
434,ep_2,SANSA, You never should have either.,5
435,ep_2,DAENERYS, I thought he knew his sister.,6
436,ep_2,SANSA, Families are complicated.,3
437,ep_2,DAENERYS, Ours certainly have been.,4
438,ep_2,SANSA, A sad thing to have in common.,7
439,ep_2,DAENERYS," We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.",38
440,ep_2,DAENERYS," And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.",18
441,ep_2,SANSA," He loves you, you know that.",6
442,ep_2,DAENERYS, That bothers you.,3
443,ep_2,SANSA, Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.,9
444,ep_2,DAENERYS," All my life, I've known one goal",7
445,ep_2,SANSA, I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.,13
446,ep_2,DAENERYS," I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.",32
447,ep_2,SANSA, Who was the first?,4
448,ep_2,DAENERYS, Someone taller.,2
449,ep_2,SANSA," And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?",14
450,ep_2,DAENERYS, I take the Iron Throne.,5
451,ep_2,SANSA," What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?",28
452,ep_2,WOLKAN," Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.",5
453,ep_2,DAENERYS, What is it?,3
454,ep_2,THEON, My queen.,2
455,ep_2,DAENERYS, Your sister?,2
456,ep_2,THEON," She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.",27
457,ep_2,DAENERYS, But why aren't you with her?,6
458,ep_2,THEON," I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.",12
459,ep_2,MAN," Milord, we're not soldiers.",4
460,ep_2,DAVOS," You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.",53
461,ep_2,MAN, Thank you.,2
462,ep_2,GILLY," When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.",10
463,ep_2,GILLY, They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.,12
464,ep_2,WOMAN, Thank you.,2
465,ep_2,TEELA, Which way should I go?,5
466,ep_2,DAVOS, Which way do you want to go?,7
467,ep_2,TEELA, All the children will be going below when the time comes.,11
468,ep_2,TEELA, But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.,11
469,ep_2,GILLY," That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.",27
470,ep_2,DAVOS, I'm sure a lot of people would.,7
471,ep_2,TEELA," All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.",7
472,ep_2,TORMUND, My little crow.,3
473,ep_2,JON, I thought we'd lost you.,5
474,ep_2,TORMUND, Almost.,1
475,ep_2,JON, How did you find each other?,6
476,ep_2,EDD, We met up at the Last Hearth.,7
477,ep_2,TORMUND, The dead got there first.,5
478,ep_2,JON, The Umbers?,2
479,ep_2,BERIC, Fighting for the Night King now.,6
480,ep_2,TORMUND, We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.,16
481,ep_2,JON, How long do we have?,5
482,ep_2,TORMUND, Before the sun comes up tomorrow.,6
483,ep_2,TORMUND, The big woman still here?,5
484,ep_2,JON, We can't beat them in a straight fight.,8
485,ep_2,JAIME," So, what can we do?",5
486,ep_2,JON, The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.,21
487,ep_2,JAIME," If that's true, he'll never expose himself.",7
488,ep_2,BRAN," Yes, he will.",3
489,ep_2,BRAN," He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.",13
490,ep_2,SAMWELL, Why? What does he want?,5
491,ep_2,BRAN," An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.",14
492,ep_2,SAMWELL," That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.",49
493,ep_2,TYRION, How will he find you?,5
494,ep_2,BRAN, His mark is on me.,5
495,ep_2,BRAN, He always knows where I am.,6
496,ep_2,JON," We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.",9
497,ep_2,BRAN, No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.,22
498,ep_2,SANSA, You want us to use you as bait?,8
499,ep_2,ARYA, We're not leaving you alone out there.,7
500,ep_2,THEON, He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.,21
501,ep_2,DAVOS, We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.,13
502,ep_2,TYRION," When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.",22
503,ep_2,DAENERYS, Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.,17
504,ep_2,TYRION," Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.",19
505,ep_2,DAENERYS," There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.",39
506,ep_2,DAVOS, The dragons should give us an edge in the field.,10
507,ep_2,JON," If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.",33
508,ep_2,ARYA, Dragonfire will stop him?,4
509,ep_2,BRAN, I don't know. No one's ever tried.,7
510,ep_2,TORMUND, We're all going to die.,5
511,ep_2,TORMUND, But at least we die together.,6
512,ep_2,JON, Let's get some rest.,4
513,ep_2,JON, Your Grace.,2
514,ep_2,TYRION, Do you need help?,4
515,ep_2,BRAN, No.,1
516,ep_2,TYRION, You've had a strange journey.,5
517,ep_2,BRAN, Stranger than most.,3
518,ep_2,TYRION, I'd like to hear about it.,6
519,ep_2,BRAN, It's a long story.,4
520,ep_2,TYRION," If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.",17
521,ep_2,MISSANDEI, Hello.,1
522,ep_2,MISSANDEI, Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.,8
523,ep_2,MISSANDEI, My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.,8
524,ep_2,SAMWELL, Have you told her yet?,5
525,ep_2,JON, No.,1
526,ep_2,SAMWELL, Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-,10
527,ep_2,EDD, And now our watch begins.,5
528,ep_2,JON, Gilly? Little Sam?,3
529,ep_2,SAMWELL, They'll be safe down in the crypt.,7
530,ep_2,JON, If you want to join them.,6
531,ep_2,JON, To protect them.,3
532,ep_2,SAMWELL, Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.,18
533,ep_2,EDD, Thenn.,1
534,ep_2,SAMWELL," I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.",29
535,ep_2,EDD," Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.",11
536,ep_2,SAMWELL," Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate.",8
537,ep_2,EDD, Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.,20
538,ep_2,SAMWELL," Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.",9
539,ep_2,JON, Now it's just us three.,5
540,ep_2,EDD," Last man left, burn the rest of us.",8
541,ep_2,TYRION, I wish Father were here.,5
542,ep_2,TYRION, I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.,22
543,ep_2,JAIME, That would be something to see.,6
544,ep_2,TYRION," I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.",15
545,ep_2,JAIME, Mm.,1
546,ep_2,TYRION, You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.,15
547,ep_2,JAIME, It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.,24
548,ep_2,TYRION, I was speaking in relative terms.,6
549,ep_2,JAIME, Do you miss it?,4
550,ep_2,TYRION, Of course I miss it.,5
551,ep_2,JAIME," Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.",14
552,ep_2,TYRION, It's not. Things would be easier if it were.,9
553,ep_2,TYRION, The perils of self-betterment.,4
554,ep_2,JAIME, Oh! My lady.,3
555,ep_2,BRIENNE," Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-",14
556,ep_2,TYRION, To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.,24
557,ep_2,PODRICK," Thank you, milord.",3
558,ep_2,BRIENNE, I don't think that's wise.,5
559,ep_2,BRIENNE, The battle might start at any moment.,7
560,ep_2,BRIENNE, Half cup.,2
561,ep_2,TYRION, And you?,2
562,ep_2,BRIENNE," No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.",10
563,ep_2,JAIME, You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.,13
564,ep_2,BRIENNE, All right. Just a bit.,5
565,ep_2,DAVOS," Well, what do we have here?",6
566,ep_2,TYRION," Ser Davos, join us.",4
567,ep_2,DAVOS," No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.",9
568,ep_2,DAVOS, I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.,22
569,ep_2,TORMUND," It could be our last night in this world, you know.",11
570,ep_2,BRIENNE," Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.",6
571,ep_2,BRIENNE, Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.,8
572,ep_2,TYRION, Would you like a drink?,5
573,ep_2,TORMUND, Brought my own.,3
574,ep_2,TORMUND," They call you ""King Killer.""",5
575,ep_2,JAIME, I'm sure someone does.,4
576,ep_2,TORMUND," They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?",8
577,ep_2,TORMUND, I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.,17
578,ep_2,TORMUND," When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.",30
579,ep_2,DAVOS, Maybe I will have that drink.,6
580,ep_2,SANDOR, You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.,14
581,ep_2,ARYA, Guess I've changed.,3
582,ep_2,ARYA, What are you doing up here?,6
583,ep_2,SANDOR, What's it look like?,4
584,ep_2,ARYA," No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?",35
585,ep_2,SANDOR," I fought for you, didn't I?",6
586,ep_2,SANDOR," Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.",12
587,ep_2,BERIC, My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.,16
588,ep_2,SANDOR, Was he on your list?,5
589,ep_2,ARYA, For a little while.,4
590,ep_2,BERIC, That's all right.,3
591,ep_2,BERIC, The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-,17
592,ep_2,SANDOR," Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.",44
593,ep_2,SANDOR, Where are you going?,4
594,ep_2,ARYA, I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.,12
595,ep_2,ARYA, That for me?,3
596,ep_2,ARYA, This'll work.,2
597,ep_2,GENDRY," Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…",17
598,ep_2,ARYA, What did the Red Woman want with you?,8
599,ep_2,GENDRY, She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.,9
600,ep_2,ARYA, Why your blood?,3
601,ep_2,GENDRY," I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard. I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.",24
602,ep_2,ARYA, Was that your first time?,5
603,ep_2,GENDRY," No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.",11
604,ep_2,ARYA, Your first time with a woman.,6
605,ep_2,GENDRY, What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.,6
606,ep_2,ARYA, Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?,10
607,ep_2,ARYA, Or after?,2
608,ep_2,ARYA, You don't remember?,3
609,ep_2,GENDRY," Yes, I was.",3
610,ep_2,ARYA, One? Two? Twenty?,3
611,ep_2,GENDRY," Well, I didn't keep count.",5
612,ep_2,ARYA," Yes, you did.",3
613,ep_2,GENDRY, Three.,1
614,ep_2,ARYA, We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.,16
615,ep_2,GENDRY," Arya, I-",2
616,ep_2,ARYA, I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.,11
617,ep_2,TYRION," It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.",27
618,ep_2,BRIENNE, At least we'll die with honor.,6
619,ep_2,TYRION, I think we might live.,5
620,ep_2,TYRION, I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.,24
621,ep_2,DAVOS, All without a shred of combat ability.,7
622,ep_2,TYRION," Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.",11
623,ep_2,JAIME, Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.,8
624,ep_2,TYRION," Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.",13
625,ep_2,TORMUND, She's not a ser? You're not a knight?,8
626,ep_2,BRIENNE, Women can't be knights.,4
627,ep_2,TORMUND, Why not?,2
628,ep_2,BRIENNE, Tradition.,1
629,ep_2,TORMUND, Fuck tradition.,2
630,ep_2,BRIENNE, I don't even want to be a knight.,8
631,ep_2,TORMUND," I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you 10 times over.",13
632,ep_2,JAIME, You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.,11
633,ep_2,JAIME, I'll prove it.,3
634,ep_2,JAIME," Kneel, Lady Brienne.",3
635,ep_2,JAIME, Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.,10
636,ep_2,JAIME," In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.",12
637,ep_2,JAIME," In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.",12
638,ep_2,JAIME," In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.",13
639,ep_2,JAIME," Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.",10
640,ep_2,TYRION, Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!,9
641,ep_2,LYANNA, I don't need you to remind me of that.,9
642,ep_2,JORAH, You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-,10
643,ep_2,LYANNA," I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.",16
644,ep_2,SAMWELL," Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-",7
645,ep_2,LYANN, It's all right. We're done here.,6
646,ep_2,LYANNA," I wish you good fortune, cousin.",6
647,ep_2,JORAH," Thank you, my lady.",4
648,ep_2,JORAH, What have you got there?,5
649,ep_2,SAMWELL, It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.,7
650,ep_2,JORAH, You still have a family.,5
651,ep_2,SAMWELL," Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.",44
652,ep_2,JORAH, I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.,12
653,ep_2,SAMWELL, I'll see you when it's through.,6
654,ep_2,SAMWELL, I hope we win.,4
655,ep_2,JAIME, We'd better get some rest.,5
656,ep_2,TYRION," No, let's stay a bit longer.",6
657,ep_2,DAVOS, We're out of wine.,4
658,ep_2,TYRION, How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?,12
659,ep_2,DAVOS, You'll pray for a quick death.,6
660,ep_2,TYRION, Ser Brienne?,2
661,ep_2,TORMUND, Mm-mm.,1
662,ep_2,TYRION, Mmm.,1
663,ep_2,PODRICK," High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most.",36
664,ep_2,DAENERYS, Who's that?,2
665,ep_2,JON, Lyanna Stark.,2
666,ep_2,DAENERYS," My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.",24
667,ep_2,JON, He didn't. He loved her.,5
668,ep_2,JON," They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.",59
669,ep_2,JON, My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.,8
670,ep_2,DAENERYS, That's impossible.,2
671,ep_2,JON, I wish it were.,4
672,ep_2,DAENERYS, Who told you this?,4
673,ep_2,JON, Bran. He saw it.,4
674,ep_2,DAENERYS, He saw it?,3
675,ep_2,JON, And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.,18
676,ep_2,DAENERYS, A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?,20
677,ep_2,JON," It's true, Dany. I know it is.",7
678,ep_2,DAENERYS," If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.",23
679,ep_2,MAN, Form up! Get yourselves back!,5
681,ep_3,NORTHMAN," Look, on the west wall!",5
682,ep_3,SOLDIER, Get down to the crypt!,5
683,ep_3,SOLDIER, Just hold.,2
684,ep_3,MAN, We'll take him.,3

686,ep_3,LYANNA," Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position.",7
687,ep_3,EDDISON," Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time.",8
688,ep_3,MELISANDRE, Do you speak their tongue?,5
689,ep_3,JORAH, (Nods.),1
690,ep_3,MELISANDRE, Tell them to lift their swords.,6
691,ep_3,JORAH, (speaks in Dothraki),3

693,ep_3,MELISANDRE, Valar morghulis.,2
694,ep_3,DAVOS, Open the gate!,3
695,ep_3,MAN, Come. Come on. Easy.,4
696,ep_3,MELISANDRE," There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn.",14
697,ep_3,SOLDIER, (in Dothraki) Cease fire!,4
698,ep_3,JON, The Night King is coming.,5
699,ep_3,DAENERYS, The dead are already here.,5
700,ep_3,TORMUND, (yells),1
701,ep_3,BRIENNE, Stand your ground!,3
702,ep_3,ARYA, Get down to the crypt.,5
703,ep_3,SANSA, I'm not abandoning my people.,5
704,ep_3,ARYA, Take this and go.,4
705,ep_3,SANSA, I don't know how to use it.,7
706,ep_3,ARYA, Stick them with the pointy end.,6
707,ep_3,SAMWELL, Edd! Edd!,2
708,ep_3,EDDISON," Sam, get up!",3
709,ep_3,EDDISON," Oh, God. Sam.",3
710,ep_3,WOMAN, Edd!,1
711,ep_3,TORMUND, Fall back! Fall back!,4
712,ep_3,BRIENNE, Fall back!,2
713,ep_3,SOLDIER, Come on!,2
714,ep_3,LYANNA, Open the gate!,3

728,ep_3,MELISANDRE, (depserately chants in Valyrian),4
729,ep_3,BERIC, Clegane.,1
730,ep_3,WOMAN, You must try not to worry yourself.,7
731,ep_3,VARYS, (Sighs.) At least we're already in a crypt.,8
732,ep_3,TYRION," If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.",18
733,ep_3,VARYS, (Scoffs.),1
734,ep_3,TYRION, What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.,13
735,ep_3,VARYS, And got your face cut in half.,7
736,ep_3,TYRION, And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...,12
737,ep_3,SANSA, You'd die. There's nothing you can do.,7
738,ep_3,TYRION, You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.,28
739,ep_3,SANSA," Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.",35
740,ep_3,TYRION, Maybe we should have stayed married.,6
741,ep_3,SANSA, You were the best of them.,6
742,ep_3,TYRION, What a terrifying thought.,4
743,ep_3,SANSA, It wouldn't work between us.,5
744,ep_3,TYRION, Why not?,2
745,ep_3,SANSA, The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.,10
746,ep_3,MISSANDEI," Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already.",16
747,ep_3,THEON, They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did,17
748,ep_3,BRAN, Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.,13
749,ep_3,BRAN, I'm going to go now.,5
750,ep_3,THEON, Go where?,2
751,ep_3,DAVOS, Man the walls!,3

754,ep_3,JAIME," Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!",9
755,ep_3,BRIENNE, Come on!,2
756,ep_3,JAIME, Get in there!,3

768,ep_3,BERIC, Tell her that.,3
769,ep_3,SANDOR, Come on!,2
770,ep_3,BERIC, Go!,1
771,ep_3,SANDOR, Come on!,2
772,ep_3,BERIC, Run!,1
773,ep_3,SANDOR, We've gotta go!,3
774,ep_3,MELISANDRE, The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.,14
775,ep_3,ARYA, I know you.,3
776,ep_3,MELISANDRE, And I know you.,4
777,ep_3,ARYA, You said we'd meet again.,5
778,ep_3,MELISANDRE, And here we are. At the end of the world.,10
779,ep_3,ARYA, You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.,13
780,ep_3,MELISANDRE, Brown eyes green eyes and blue eyes.,7
781,ep_3,MELISANDRE, What do we say to the God of Death?,9
782,ep_3,ARYA, Not today.,2
783,ep_3,THEON, Here they come!,3
784,ep_3,THEON," Steady, lads.",2
785,ep_3,THEON, Steady now. Make every shot count.,6
786,ep_3,JON, Get off.,2

789,ep_3,JON, Bran!,1
790,ep_3,DAENERYS, Go!,1
791,ep_3,DAENERYS, Jorah!,1
792,ep_3,BRAN, Theon.,1
793,ep_3,BRAN, You're a good man.,4
794,ep_3,THEON, (Nods.),1
795,ep_3,BRAN, Thank you.,2
796,ep_3,JORAH, I'm hurt.,2
798,ep_4,JON, We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.,102
800,ep_4,MAN, To your health.,3
801,ep_4,GENDRY, Have you seen Arya?,4
802,ep_4,SANDOR," You can still smell the burning bodies, and that’s where your head is at.",14
803,ep_4,GENDRY, I just want to thank her for--,7
804,ep_4,SANDOR, I'm sure you do.,4
805,ep_4,GENDRY," Look, it's not about that.",5
806,ep_4,SANDOR," Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.",17
807,ep_4,DAENERYS, Gendry.,1
808,ep_4,DAENERYS," That's right, isn't it?",4
809,ep_4,GENDRY," Yes, Your Grace.",3
810,ep_4,DAENERYS, You’re Robert Baratheon’s son.,4
811,ep_4,GENDRY, (nods),1
812,ep_4,DAENERYS, You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?,14
813,ep_4,GENDRY, I didn’t even know he was my father until after he was dead.,13
814,ep_4,DAENERYS," Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?",14
815,ep_4,GENDRY," I don’t know, Your Grace.",5
816,ep_4,DAENERYS, Does anyone?,2
817,ep_4,DAENERYS,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.,9
818,ep_4,GENDRY, I can't be. I'm a bastard.,6
819,ep_4,DAENERYS," No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.",23
820,ep_4,DAVOS, To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.,7
821,ep_4,ALL, To Gendry!,2
822,ep_4,SAMWELL," (to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.",5
823,ep_4,TYRION, And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.,13
824,ep_4,DAENERYS, See? You're not the only one who's clever.,8
825,ep_4,WOMAN, I have to go down and get another barrel.,9
826,ep_4,JAIME," We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?",19
827,ep_4,DAVOS," The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.",18
828,ep_4,TYRION, I'm sure you had your reasons.,6
829,ep_4,DAVOS, I did. I do.,4
830,ep_4,TYRION, So did you?,3
831,ep_4,DAVOS," Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?",45
832,ep_4,TYRION, I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.,14
833,ep_4,DAVOS, And what if I'm not trying to be happy?,9
834,ep_4,TYRION," Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.",17
835,ep_4,DAVOS, Thank you. I feel much better.,6
836,ep_4,MAN, More ale!,2
837,ep_4,TYRION, This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.,12
838,ep_4,BRAN, It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.,20
839,ep_4,TYRION, You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.,15
840,ep_4,BRAN, I'm not Lord of Winterfell.,5
841,ep_4,TYRION, You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.,9
842,ep_4,TYRION, You don't want it.,4
843,ep_4,BRAN, I don't really want anymore.,5
844,ep_4,TYRION, I envy you.,3
845,ep_4,BRAN, You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.,10
846,ep_4,TORMUND, All of it.,3
847,ep_4,MAN, Go on.,2
848,ep_4,JON," No, not in one go.",5
849,ep_4,SANSA, Go on. I believe in you.,6
850,ep_4,TORMUND, We have to celebrate our victory.,6
851,ep_4,JON, Vomiting is not celebrating.,4
852,ep_4,TORMUND," Yes, it is.",3
853,ep_4,TORMUND, Ah! To the Dragon Queen!,5
854,ep_4,DAENERYS," To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!",7
855,ep_4,ALL, Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!,4
856,ep_4,WOMAN, Drink!,1
857,ep_4,TORMUND, I'm fine!,2
858,ep_4,TYRION, (drunkenly) Your turn.,3
859,ep_4,JAIME, (to BRIENNE) Um You are an only child.,8
860,ep_4,BRIENNE, I told you I was.,5
861,ep_4,JAIME, You didn't.,2
862,ep_4,BRIENNE, I did.,2
863,ep_4,JAIME, I surmised it.,3
864,ep_4,TYRION, Drink.,1
865,ep_4,TYRION, Go again.,2
866,ep_4,BRIENNE, Why does he get to go again?,7
867,ep_4,TYRION, Because it's my game.,4
868,ep_4,JAIME, You have danced with Renly Baratheon.,6
869,ep_4,PODRICK, (to Brienne) No.,3
870,ep_4,TYRION, Drink.,1
871,ep_4,MAN, The other way around!,4
872,ep_4,TORMUND, I saw him riding that thing.,6
873,ep_4,DAVOS, We all did.,3
874,ep_4,TORMUND, No. No. I saw him riding that thing.,8
875,ep_4,DAVOS," That's right, you did.",4
876,ep_4,TORMUND, I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.,17
877,ep_4,TORMUND, (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!,17
878,ep_4,TORMUND," Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.",9
879,ep_4,TORMUND, Not this one.,3
880,ep_4,JON," Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.",8
881,ep_4,TORMUND," Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.",23
882,ep_4,TORMUND, He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!,22
883,ep_4,TYRION, Drink.,1
884,ep_4,JAIME, Drink.,1
885,ep_4,PODRICK, Drink.,1
886,ep_4,BRIENNE," Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!",5
887,ep_4,TYRION, Mm!,1
888,ep_4,BRIENNE, You were married. Before Sansa.,5
889,ep_4,JAIME, Drink.,1
890,ep_4,BRIENNE," You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!",7
891,ep_4,TYRION, No!,1
892,ep_4,TYRION, You're a virgin.,3
893,ep_4,JAIME, That's a statement about the present.,6
894,ep_4,TYRION," At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman.",20
895,ep_4,BRIENNE, I have to piss.,4
896,ep_4,TORMUND," We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?",28
897,ep_4,BRIENNE, Please pardon me for a moment.,6
898,ep_4,MAN, Drink it!,2
899,ep_4,SANDOR, Don't touch me.,3
900,ep_4,WILLA, You can touch me.,4
901,ep_4,WILLA, I'm not afraid of wildlings.,5
902,ep_4,TORMUND, Maybe you should be.,4
903,ep_4,TORMUND," Well, Clegane it's time to drown our sorrows.",8
904,ep_4,SANDOR, I'm not done with my drink.,6
905,ep_4,SARRA, Are you ready now?,4
906,ep_4,SANDOR, This is my drink.,4
907,ep_4,MAN, All right!,2
908,ep_4,SANSA," She could have made you happy, for a little while.",10
909,ep_4,SANDOR, There's only one thing that'll make me happy.,8
910,ep_4,SANSA, And what's that?,3
911,ep_4,SANDOR, That's my fucking business.,4
912,ep_4,SANDOR, Used to be you couldn't look at me.,8
913,ep_4,SANSA, That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.,14
914,ep_4,SANDOR," Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough.",14
915,ep_4,SANSA, And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.,11
916,ep_4,SANDOR, How?,1
917,ep_4,SANSA, Hounds.,1
918,ep_4,SANDOR," You've changed, Little Bird.",4
919,ep_4,SANDOR," None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me. No Littlefinger, no Ramsay none of it.",20
920,ep_4,SANSA," Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.",17
922,ep_4,GENDRY, Don't shoot.,2
923,ep_4,GENDRY," It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating with them.",13
924,ep_4,ARYA, I am celebrating.,3
925,ep_4,GENDRY," Yeah, I am too. I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore. I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. By order of the queen.",21
926,ep_4,ARYA, Congratulations.,1
927,ep_4,GENDRY," I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me. So be with me.",45
928,ep_4,GENDRY, Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.,9
929,ep_4,ARYA," You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not a lady. I never have been. That's not me.",26
931,ep_4,JAIME, You didn't drink.,3
932,ep_4,BRIENNE, I didn't drink?,3
933,ep_4,JAIME, In the game.,3
934,ep_4,BRIENNE, I drank.,2
935,ep_4,JAIME, In the game. This is Dornish.,6
936,ep_4,BRIENNE, This is not the game. This is only drinking.,9
937,ep_4,JAIME, Suit yourself.,2
938,ep_4,JAIME, You keep it warm enough in here.,7
939,ep_4,BRIENNE," It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North. Keep your fire going. Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.",26
940,ep_4,JAIME, That's very diligent. Very responsible.,5
941,ep_4,BRIENNE, Piss off.,2
942,ep_4,JAIME, You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.,15
943,ep_4,BRIENNE, It grows on you.,4
944,ep_4,JAIME, I don't want things growing on me.,7
945,ep_4,JAIME, How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.,16
946,ep_4,BRIENNE, (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.,6
947,ep_4,JAIME," (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.",10
948,ep_4,BRIENNE," Oh, move aside.",3
949,ep_4,BRIENNE, What are you doing?,4
950,ep_4,JAIME, I'm taking your shirt off.,5
951,ep_4,JAIME, I've never slept with a knight before.,7
952,ep_4,BRIENNE, I've never slept with anyone before.,6
953,ep_4,JAIME, Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.,9
954,ep_4,BRIENNE, I told you--,3
956,ep_4,DAENERYS, Are you drunk?,3
957,ep_4,JON, No.,1
958,ep_4,JON, Only a little.,3
959,ep_4,JON," I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you.",25
960,ep_4,DAENERYS, He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you.,20
961,ep_4,DAENERYS, Is that all right?,4
962,ep_4,DAENERYS," I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.",15
963,ep_4,DAENERYS," I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.",49
964,ep_4,JON, I told you I don't want it.,7
965,ep_4,DAENERYS," (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?",30
966,ep_4,JON, I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.,14
967,ep_4,DAENERYS," (desperately)You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.",65
968,ep_4,DAENERYS, I want it to be the way it was between us.,11
969,ep_4,JON, I have to tell Sansa and Arya.,7
970,ep_4,DAENERYS, Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.,13
971,ep_4,JON, She won't.,2
972,ep_4,DAENERYS," She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.",20
973,ep_4,JON, I owe them the truth.,5
974,ep_4,DAENERYS, Even if the truth destroys us?,6
975,ep_4,JON, It won't.,2
976,ep_4,DAENERYS, It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.,15
977,ep_4,JON, You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.,17
978,ep_4,DAENERYS, We can. I've just told you how.,7
981,ep_4,JON, The Northmen as well.,4
982,ep_4,VARYS," And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.",20
983,ep_4,MISSANDEI," When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them--",15
984,ep_4,DAENERYS, Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.,21
985,ep_4,TYRION, The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.,11
986,ep_4,VARYS," Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.",26
987,ep_4,DAENERYS," No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital.",30
988,ep_4,TYRION," I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.",31
989,ep_4,JON," We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.",33
990,ep_4,TYRION," Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.",14
991,ep_4,DAENERYS, All right.,2
992,ep_4,SANSA, The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.,23
993,ep_4,DAENERYS, How long do you suggest?,5
994,ep_4,SANSA," I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.",11
995,ep_4,DAENERYS," I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.",27
996,ep_4,SANSA, It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?,20
997,ep_4,DAENERYS,"THE longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.",11
998,ep_4,JON, (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.,21
999,ep_4,JON," What you command, we will obey.",6
1000,ep_4,TYRION, So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.,28
1001,ep_4,TYRION," A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.",26
1002,ep_4,TYRION," Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.",15
1003,ep_4,DAENERYS," We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.",28
1004,ep_4,ARYA, We need a word.,4
1006,ep_4,JON, You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.,18
1007,ep_4,SANSA, Arya's the one that killed the Night King.,8
1008,ep_4,JON, Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--,7
1009,ep_4,SANSA, And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--,17
1010,ep_4,JON, I swore myself and the North to her cause.,9
1011,ep_4,ARYA, I respect that.,3
1012,ep_4,SANSA, You respect it?,3
1013,ep_4,ARYA," We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.",27
1014,ep_4,JON, You don't know her yet.,5
1015,ep_4,ARYA, I'll never know her. She's not one of us.,9
1016,ep_4,JON," If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.",15
1017,ep_4,ARYA, That's all right. I don't need many allies.,8
1018,ep_4,JON, Arya -,2
1019,ep_4,ARYA, We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.,11
1020,ep_4,JON, I've never been a Stark.,5
1021,ep_4,SANSA, You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.,13
1022,ep_4,ARYA, You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.,12
1023,ep_4,BRAN, It's your choice.,3
1024,ep_4,JON, I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.,16
1025,ep_4,ARYA, What is it?,3
1026,ep_4,JON," You have to swear it, before I tell you.",9
1027,ep_4,SANSA, How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?,16
1028,ep_4,JON, Because we're family. Swear it.,5
1029,ep_4,ARYA, I swear it.,3
1030,ep_4,SANSA, I swear it.,3
1031,ep_4,JON, (to BRAN) Tell them.,4
1034,ep_4,TYRION, So she's going to stay here with you?,8
1035,ep_4,JAIME," She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.",11
1036,ep_4,TYRION, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.,17
1037,ep_4,TYRION, Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains.,14
1038,ep_4,JAIME, To climbing mountains.,3
1039,ep_4,TYRION, What's she like down there?,5
1040,ep_4,JAIME, What? That's not your concern.,5
1041,ep_4,TYRION, I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.,12
1042,ep_4,JAIME, You're a dog.,3
1043,ep_4,TYRION," I am the Imp, and I demand to know.",9
1044,ep_4,BRONN," I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall, blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.",19
1045,ep_4,TYRION, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you-- What are you doing up North?,17
1046,ep_4,JAIME, What are you doing with that?,6
1047,ep_4,BRONN," Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.",10
1048,ep_4,TYRION, You're supposed to be south.,5
1049,ep_4,BRONN, You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?,12
1050,ep_4,TYRION, That's a bit rude.,4
1051,ep_4,BRONN," Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, - and what do I have to show?",15
1052,ep_4,TYRION," You're a knight, thanks to me.",6
1053,ep_4,BRONN, Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.,17
1054,ep_4,JAIME, Power resides where men believe--,5
1055,ep_4,BRONN, Shut your mouth.,3
1056,ep_4,TYRION, I'm just trying--,3
1057,ep_4,BRONN," I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.",15
1058,ep_4,TYRION," See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--",9
1059,ep_4,BRONN," You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone.",18
1060,ep_4,TYRION, You broke my nose!,4
1061,ep_4,BRONN, I did not break your nose.,6
1062,ep_4,TYRION, How do you know?,4
1063,ep_4,BRONN," Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.",37
1064,ep_4,JAIME, And you trust Cersei--,4
1065,ep_4,BRONN," I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.",46
1066,ep_4,BRONN," Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden -",34
1067,ep_4,TYRION, May I speak?,3
1068,ep_4,BRONN, Why not? Only death will shut you up.,8
1069,ep_4,TYRION, We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?,9
1070,ep_4,BRONN," If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?",15
1071,ep_4,TYRION, Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.,8
1072,ep_4,JAIME, Highgarden? Are you mad?,4
1073,ep_4,TYRION, It's better than being dead.,5
1074,ep_4,JAIME, He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if--,13
1075,ep_4,BRONN," The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.",14
1076,ep_4,JAIME, Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.,7
1077,ep_4,BRONN," No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.",71
1078,ep_4,BRONN, Highgarden. Give me your word.,5
1079,ep_4,TYRION," You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses. BRONN; (chuckles) Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don't die.",67
1081,ep_4,SANDOR, For fuck's sake.,3
1082,ep_4,ARAY, On your own?,3
1083,ep_4,SANDOR, Not anymore. I don't like crowds.,6
1084,ep_4,ARYA, Me neither.,2
1085,ep_4,SANDOR, Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.,11
1086,ep_4,ARYA, Don't like heroes.,3
1087,ep_4,SANDOR, It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.,12
1088,ep_4,ARYA, Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?,9
1089,ep_4,SANDOR, I have some unfinished business.,5
1090,ep_4,ARYA, Me too.,2
1091,ep_4,SANDOR, I don't plan on coming back.,6
1092,ep_4,ARYA, Neither do I.,3
1093,ep_4,SANDOR, Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?,10
1094,ep_4,ARYA, Probably.,1
1097,ep_4,TYRION, My lady.,2
1098,ep_4,TYRION," ""My lord"" is the standard response.",6
1099,ep_4,SANSA, Why her?,2
1100,ep_4,TYRION, You know she loves your brother.,6
1101,ep_4,SANSA, That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.,8
1102,ep_4,TYRION," You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.",28
1103,ep_4,SANSA," Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.",13
1104,ep_4,TYRION, I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.,11
1105,ep_4,SANSA," Well, I suppose that's up to him.",7
1106,ep_4,TYRION," Sansa, look at me.",4
1107,ep_4,TYRION," With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.",32
1108,ep_4,SANSA, What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--,17
1109,ep_4,TYRION, She's your queen too.,4
1110,ep_4,TYRION," You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, - or the North, or--?",26
1111,ep_4,SANSA, You're afraid of her.,4
1112,ep_4,TYRION, Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.,10
1113,ep_4,SANSA, I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.,19
1114,ep_4,TYRION," No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.",12
1115,ep_4,TYRION, Are you all right?,4
1116,ep_4,TYRION," Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her.",27
1117,ep_4,SANSA, Tyrion. What if there's someone else? Someone better?,8
1119,ep_4,TORMUND, You're not gonna ride the dragon south?,7
1120,ep_4,JON, Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.,14
1121,ep_4,TORMUND, (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.,9
1122,ep_4,JON, (laughs),1
1123,ep_4,TORMUND, I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.,19
1124,ep_4,JON," This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.",14
1125,ep_4,TORMUND, It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.,26
1126,ep_4,JON, It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.,24
1127,ep_4,TORMUND, So would you.,3
1128,ep_4,JON," I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then.",11
1129,ep_4,TORMUND, You never know.,3
1130,ep_4,TORMUND, You've got the North in you. The real North.,9
1131,ep_4,SAMWELL," Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we--",28
1132,ep_4,GILLY," I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.",18
1133,ep_4,JON, I hope it's a girl.,5
1134,ep_4,SAMWELL, You're the best friend I ever had.,7
1135,ep_4,JON," You too, Sam.",3
1138,ep_4,TYRION," Think of the past 20 years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.",25
1139,ep_4,VARYS, How many others know?,4
1140,ep_4,TYRION, Including us? Eight.,3
1141,ep_4,VARYS," Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?",23
1142,ep_4,TYRION," She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.",14
1143,ep_4,VARYS," No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne.",13
1144,ep_4,TYRION, He doesn't want the throne.,5
1145,ep_4,VARYS," I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero.",22
1146,ep_4,TYRION," He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together.",16
1147,ep_4,VARYS, She's his aunt.,3
1148,ep_4,TYRION, That never stopped a Targaryen before.,6
1149,ep_4,VARYS," No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.",41
1150,ep_4,TYRION, Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.,11
1151,ep_4,VARYS, I worry about her state of mind.,7
1152,ep_4,TYRION, We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.,35
1154,ep_4,MISSANDEI, No!,1
1157,ep_4,CERSEI," Our message was well-received, then?",5
1158,ep_4,QYBURN, Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.,21
1159,ep_4,CERSEI, You're certain about the dragon?,5
1160,ep_4,EURION, I saw it sink beneath the waves.,7
1161,ep_4,CERSEI, That must have been glorious.,5
1162,ep_4,EURON," The glory is yours, my queen.",6
1163,ep_4,CERSEI," When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all.",26
1164,ep_4,EURON, She's coming for you.,4
1165,ep_4,CERSEI," Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.",24
1166,ep_4,CERSEI," So much for ""the Breaker of Chains.""",7
1168,ep_4,VARYS, Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.,28
1169,ep_4,DAENERYS, You saw my child fall from the sky.,8
1170,ep_4,VARYS, (nods),1
1171,ep_4,DAENERYS, They took Missandei.,3
1172,ep_4,VARYS," Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.",70
1173,ep_4,DAENERYS," Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.",31
1174,ep_4,TYRION," It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.",45
1175,ep_4,DAENERYS," Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.",41
1177,ep_4,VARYS, I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.,12
1178,ep_4,TYRION, She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?,24
1179,ep_4,VARYS, Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.,18
1180,ep_4,TYRION, And how do you know she wasn't?,7
1181,ep_4,VARYS," Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?",27
1182,ep_4,TYRION, He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.,11
1183,ep_4,VARYS, Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?,14
1184,ep_4,TYRION, We're discussing treason.,3
1185,ep_4,VARYS, Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.,7
1186,ep_4,TYRION, Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.,9
1187,ep_4,VARYS," He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.",24
1188,ep_4,TYRION," Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.",18
1189,ep_4,VARYS," And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.",17
1190,ep_4,TYRION, What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.,13
1191,ep_4,VARYS," She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.",15
1192,ep_4,TYRION, He could temper her worst impulses.,6
1193,ep_4,VARYS, As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.,33
1194,ep_4,TYRION, How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.,13
1195,ep_4,VARYS, You've always known my reasons.,5
1196,ep_4,TYRION," At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.",17
1197,ep_4,VARYS, Even if you know it's a mistake?,7
1198,ep_4,TYRION, I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors.,17
1199,ep_4,VARYS, You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.,14
1200,ep_4,TYRION," What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.",23
1201,ep_4,VARYS," Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.",51
1202,ep_4,TYRION," So, what happens to her?",5
1203,ep_4,TYRION, Please. Don't.,2
1204,ep_4,VARYS, I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.,20
1206,ep_4,SANSA, . . . as are the rest of her advisors.,10
1207,ep_4,JAIME, What happened?,2
1208,ep_4,BRIENNE," Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured.",19
1209,ep_4,SANSA, I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.,18
1212,ep_4,BRIENNE, They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.,10
1213,ep_4,JAIME, Have you ever run away from a fight?,8
1214,ep_4,BRIENNE, You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.,37
1215,ep_4,JAIME," You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.",47
1216,ep_4,JAIME, She's hateful. And so am I.,6
1218,ep_4,QYBURN, My lord.,2
1219,ep_4,TYRION, Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.,14
1220,ep_4,QYBURN," Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.",17
1221,ep_4,TYRION," Qyburn, you're a rational man.",5
1222,ep_4,QYBURN," Or so I flatter myself, my lord.",7
1223,ep_4,TYRION," We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.",12
1224,ep_4,QYBURN, Yes.,1
1225,ep_4,TYRION, Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.,21
1226,ep_4,QYBURN," No, it is not a pleasant sound.",7
1227,ep_4,TYRION, I-- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.,12
1228,ep_4,QYBURN," My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.",10
1229,ep_4,TYRION, Your queen.,2
1230,ep_4,QYBURN, Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.,11
1231,ep_4,TYRION, Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.,11
1232,ep_4,QYBURN," We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--",27
1233,ep_4,CAPTAIN, Ready! Nock! Draw!,3
1234,ep_4,TYRION," I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die.",79
1235,ep_4,CERSEI," (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time.",12
1236,ep_4,MISSANDEI, Dracarys.,1
1238,ep_5,VARYS, Come in.,2
1239,ep_5,VARYS, And?,1
1240,ep_5,MARTHA, (shakes her head),3
1241,ep_5,VARYS, Nothing?,1
1242,ep_5,MARTHA, She won't eat.,3
1243,ep_5,VARYS, We'll try again at supper.,5
1244,ep_5,MARTHA, I think they're watching me.,5
1245,ep_5,VARYS, Who?,1
1246,ep_5,MARTHA, Her soldiers.,2
1247,ep_5,VARYS, Of course they are. That's their job.,7
1248,ep_5,VARYS," What have I told you, Martha?",6
1249,ep_5,MARTHA," The greater the risk, the greater the reward.",8
1250,ep_5,VARYS, (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.,10
1252,ep_5,VARYS, The Northern armies?,3
1253,ep_5,JON, Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?,18
1254,ep_5,VARYS," She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.",15
1255,ep_5,JON, She shouldn't be alone.,4
1256,ep_5,VARYS, You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.,8
1257,ep_5,JON, Aren't you worried for her?,5
1258,ep_5,VARYS," I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.",25
1259,ep_5,JON, We're not much for riddles where I'm from.,8
1260,ep_5,VARYS, We both know what she's about to do.,8
1261,ep_5,JON, That's her decision to make. She is our queen.,9
1262,ep_5,VARYS," Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.",11
1263,ep_5,JON, What do you want?,4
1264,ep_5,VARYS, All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.,26
1265,ep_5,JON, I don't want it. I never have.,7
1266,ep_5,VARYS," (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true",42
1267,ep_5,JON, She is my queen.,4
1269,ep_5,TYRION, Your Grace?,2
1270,ep_5,TYRION, There's something you need to know.,6
1271,ep_5,DAENERYS, Someone has betrayed me.,4
1272,ep_5,TYRION, Yes.,1
1273,ep_5,DAENERYS, Jon Snow.,2
1274,ep_5,TYRION, Varys.,1
1275,ep_5,DAENERYS, He knows the truth about Jon.,6
1276,ep_5,TYRION, He does.,2
1277,ep_5,DAENERYS," Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said he betrayed me.",27
1278,ep_5,TYRION, I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.,19
1279,ep_5,DAENERYS, And Varys?,2
1280,ep_5,TYRION, Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.,9
1281,ep_5,DAENERYS, (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.,14
1282,ep_5,TYRION, It was a mistake.,4
1283,ep_5,DAENERYS, Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?,15
1284,ep_5,TYRION, She trusts me.,3
1285,ep_5,DAENERYS," Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.",23
1286,ep_5,TYRION," If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.",29
1287,ep_5,TYRION, But it doesn't matter now.,5
1288,ep_5,DAENERYS, No. It doesn't matter now.,5
1290,ep_5,TYRION, It was me.,3
1291,ep_5,VARYS," (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.",16
1292,ep_5,DAENERYS," Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...",19
1293,ep_5,DAENERYS, ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.,6
1295,ep_5,DAENERYS, This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.,16
1296,ep_5,DAENERYS," (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.",12
1297,ep_5,DAENERYS, What did I say would happen if you told your sister?,11
1298,ep_5,JON," I don't want it, and that's what I told him.",10
1299,ep_5,DAENERYS, She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.,49
1300,ep_5,JON, I love you. And you will always be my queen.,10
1301,ep_5,DAENERYS, Is that all I am to you? Your queen?,9
1302,ep_5,DAENERYS," All right, then.",3
1303,ep_5,DAENERYS, Let it be fear.,4
1305,ep_5,TYRION," The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.",18
1306,ep_5,DAENERYS," In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.",17
1307,ep_5,TYRION, They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.,20
1308,ep_5,DAENERYS, They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?,11
1309,ep_5,TYRION, What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.,17
1310,ep_5,DAENERYS, Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy IS,18
1311,ep_5,TYRION," I beg you, my queen--",5
1312,ep_5,DAENERYS, But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.,22
1313,ep_5,DAENERYS, (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing - to join the Northern armies.,18
1314,ep_5,TYRION," Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.",41
1315,ep_5,DAENERYS, Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.,11
1316,ep_5,DAENERYS, Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.,10
1317,ep_5,DAENERYS, It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.,23
1320,ep_5,DAVOS, The rearguard should be here by daybreak.,7
1321,ep_5,TYRION, She wants to attack now.,5
1322,ep_5,JON, Daybreak at the earliest.,4
1323,ep_5,TYRION," Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?",15
1324,ep_5,DAVOS," I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?",8
1326,ep_5,ARYA, I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.,9
1327,ep_5,SANDOR," Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.",20
1328,ep_5,SANDOR," Go ahead, talk to him.",5
1329,ep_5,TYRION, (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.,9
1330,ep_5,TYRION, (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.,9
1331,ep_5,TYRION, (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...,10
1332,ep_5,UNSULLIED, We speak the common tongue.,5
1333,ep_5,TYRION, Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.,19
1334,ep_5,UNSULLIED, We have orders to guard the prisoner.,7
1335,ep_5,TYRION, Ordered by whom? The queen herself?,6
1336,ep_5,UNSULLIED, No.,1
1337,ep_5,TYRION," Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.",20
1338,ep_5,TYRION, How did they find you?,5
1339,ep_5,TYRION, Did you consider taking it off?,6
1340,ep_5,JAIME," Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister.""",7
1341,ep_5,TYRION," And you're going back to her, to die with her.",10
1342,ep_5,JAIME, You've underestimated her before.,4
1343,ep_5,TYRION, She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.,15
1344,ep_5,JAIME, Difficult to do from here.,5
1345,ep_5,JAIME, When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?,11
1346,ep_5,TYRION," Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.",23
1347,ep_5,JAIME," To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.",13
1348,ep_5,TYRION, You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.,19
1349,ep_5,JAIME," The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.",28
1350,ep_5,TYRION," She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.",14
1351,ep_5,JAIME, Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.,11
1352,ep_5,TYRION, The city will fall tomorrow.,5
1353,ep_5,JAIME," She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company--",10
1354,ep_5,TYRION, I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.,19
1355,ep_5,JAIME," Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.",9
1356,ep_5,TYRION, Why?,1
1357,ep_5,TYRION," Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.",73
1358,ep_5,JAIME, Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war--,21
1359,ep_5,TYRION," There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.",19
1360,ep_5,TYRION, Swear to me.,3
1361,ep_5,JAIME, You have my word.,4
1362,ep_5,TYRION," If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.",28
1363,ep_5,JAIME, I'll try.,2
1364,ep_5,TYRION," I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.",17
1365,ep_5,JAIME, Your queen will execute you for this.,7
1366,ep_5,TYRION," If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.",26
1367,ep_5,TYRION," Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.",28
1368,ep_5,JAIME, You would have.,3
1369,ep_5,TYRION, You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.,17

1421,ep_5,JON, Find somewhere to hide.,4
1422,ep_5,MAN, My God!,2
1423,ep_5,EURON, The Kingslayer.,2
1424,ep_5,JAIME, We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.,10
1425,ep_5,EURON, Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.,10
1426,ep_5,JAIME," Well, maybe for you.",4
1427,ep_5,EURON, If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.,13
1428,ep_5,JAIME, You're no king.,3
1429,ep_5,EURON," Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.",26
1430,ep_5,QYBURN," Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.",8
1431,ep_5,CERSEI, The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.,10
1432,ep_5,QYBURN, The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.,10
1433,ep_5,QYBURN, Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.,12
1434,ep_5,EURON, You fought well for a cripple.,6
1435,ep_5,EURON, Another king for you.,4
1436,ep_5,EURON, But I got you! {JAIME walks into the mouth of the cave and into the lit passage beyond.,18
1437,ep_5,EURON, I got you!,3
1438,ep_5,EURON, I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.,7
1439,ep_5,SANDOR," Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.",13
1440,ep_5,SANDOR, Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.,24
1441,ep_5,ARYA, I'm going to kill her.,5
1442,ep_5,SANDOR, You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.,15
1443,ep_5,SANDOR, It's all I care about. And look at me.,9
1444,ep_5,SANDOR, Look at me! You wanna be like me?,8
1445,ep_5,SANDOR," You come with me, you die here.",7
1446,ep_5,ARYA, Sandor.,1
1447,ep_5,ARYA, Thank you.,2
1448,ep_5,SANDOR, Your Grace.,2
1449,ep_5,SANDOR," Hello, big brother.",3
1450,ep_5,CERSEI," Ser Gregor, stay by my side.",6
1451,ep_5,CERSEI," Ser Gregor, I command you.",5
1452,ep_5,QYBURN," Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.",5
1453,ep_5,SANDOR," Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.",8
1454,ep_5,CERSEI, You're hurt.,2
1455,ep_5,JAIME, It doesn't matter.,3
1456,ep_5,CERSEI, You're bleeding.,2
1457,ep_5,OWEN, Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?,12
1458,ep_5,ARYA, Let go.,2
1459,ep_5,OWEN, Have you seen my wife?,5
1460,ep_5,MAN, Out of the way!,4
1461,ep_5,MAN, No!,1
1462,ep_5,SANDOR, Oh.,1
1463,ep_5,NORA, Take my hand. Take my hand. Get up. Get up.,10
1464,ep_5,NORA, No. No.,2
1465,ep_5,ARYA, Wait! Wait! No!,3
1466,ep_5,SANDOR, Fucking die!,2
1467,ep_5,JON, We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!,12
1468,ep_5,JON, Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!,11
1469,ep_5,ARYA, You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.,9
1470,ep_5,ARYA, You have to.,3
1471,ep_5,ARYA," If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me.",8
1472,ep_5,ARYA, Follow me!,2
1473,ep_5,GIRL, Mama! Mama! Mama!,3
1474,ep_5,VICKY, No. Mama! Mama! Mama!,4
1475,ep_5,ARYA, Get up. Get up!,4
1476,ep_5,ARYA, We have to keep moving.,5
1477,ep_5,NORA, Take her. Take her!,4
1478,ep_5,NORA, Take her.,2
1479,ep_5,ARYA, Come on! Come on!,4
1480,ep_5,JAIME, This way.,2
1481,ep_5,CERSEI, I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.,18
1482,ep_5,CERSEI," Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die.",10
1483,ep_5,JAIME, It's all right.,3
1484,ep_5,CERSEI, Please don't let me die.,5
1485,ep_5,JAIME, It's all right.,3
1486,ep_5,CERSEI, I don't want to die.,5
1487,ep_5,JAIME, Just look-- Look at me. Look at me.,8
1488,ep_5,CERSEI, Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.,9
1489,ep_5,JAIME, Look-- Look-- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look-- Look at me! Just look at me.,19
1490,ep_5,JAIME, Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.,8
1492,ep_6,TYRION, I'll find you later.,4
1493,ep_6,JON, It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.,10
1494,ep_6,TYRION, I'm going alone.,3
1496,ep_6,JON, Grey Worm!,2
1497,ep_6,JON, It's over.,2
1498,ep_6,DAVOS, How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.,14
1499,ep_6,DAVOS," Look around you, friend. We won.",6
1500,ep_6,JON, And what are the queen's commands?,6
1501,ep_6,DAVOS," Easy, men. Easy! Easy.",4
1502,ep_6,DAVOS, Jon. We should speak with the queen.,7
1507,ep_6,DAENERYS, (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.,6
1508,ep_6,DAENERYS, You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.,15
1509,ep_6,DAENERYS, Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.,12
1510,ep_6,DAENERYS, Torgo Nudho.,2
1511,ep_6,DAENERYS," (in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.",36
1512,ep_6,DAENERYS, (in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!,34
1513,ep_6,DAENERYS, (in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!,25
1514,ep_6,DAENERYS," (in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.",29
1515,ep_6,DAENERYS, (in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?,9
1516,ep_6,DAENERYS, You freed your brother. You committed treason.,7
1517,ep_6,TYRION, I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.,9
1518,ep_6,DAENERYS, (In Valyrian) Take him.,4
1519,ep_6,JON, What are you doing here?,5
1520,ep_6,JON," Hey, what happened?",3
1521,ep_6,ARYA, I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.,10
1522,ep_6,JON, (sighs) She's everyone's queen now.,5
1523,ep_6,ARYA, Try telling Sansa.,3
1524,ep_6,JON, Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.,11
1525,ep_6,ARYA, Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.,26
1528,ep_6,TYRION, Did you bring any wine?,5
1529,ep_6,JON, No.,1
1530,ep_6,TYRION, Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ASHES,40
1531,ep_6,JON, (sighs),1
1532,ep_6,TYRION, So is there life after death?,6
1533,ep_6,JON, Not that I've seen.,4
1534,ep_6,TYRION, I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.,28
1535,ep_6,JON, You didn't.,2
1536,ep_6,TYRION," I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.",25
1537,ep_6,JON, I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.,14
1538,ep_6,TYRION," Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?",18
1539,ep_6,TYRION, She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,32
1540,ep_6,JON," And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.",10
1541,ep_6,TYRION, Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.,24
1542,ep_6,JON," You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.",35
1543,ep_6,TYRION," My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.",40
1544,ep_6,JON, Cersei left her no choice.,5
1545,ep_6,TYRION," The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.",9
1546,ep_6,JON, She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.,14
1547,ep_6,TYRION, And she burned down a city for it.,8
1548,ep_6,JON," Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.",12
1549,ep_6,TYRION, Would you have done it?,5
1550,ep_6,JON, What?,1
1551,ep_6,TYRION," You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",19
1552,ep_6,JON, I don't know.,3
1553,ep_6,TYRION," (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.",17
1554,ep_6,JON, What's it matter what I'd do?,6
1555,ep_6,TYRION," It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.",26
1556,ep_6,JON, (sighs),1
1557,ep_6,TYRION," When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?",83
1558,ep_6,TYRION, I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.,37
1559,ep_6,JON," ""Love is the death of duty.""",6
1560,ep_6,TYRION, You just came up with that?,6
1561,ep_6,JON, Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.,8
1562,ep_6,TYRION," Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?",44
1563,ep_6,TYRION, It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,32
1564,ep_6,JON, That's her decision. She is the queen.,7
1565,ep_6,JON, I'm sorry it came to this.,6
1566,ep_6,TYRION, And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,10
1567,ep_6,JON, My sisters will be loyal to the throne.,8
1568,ep_6,TYRION, Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,19
1569,ep_6,JON, She doesn't get to choose.,5
1570,ep_6,TYRION, No. But you do. And you have to choose now.,10
1574,ep_6,DAENERYS," When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",60
1575,ep_6,JON, I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.,17
1576,ep_6,DAENERYS, It was necessary.,3
1577,ep_6,JON," Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!",13
1578,ep_6,DAENERYS, I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.,22
1579,ep_6,JON, And Tyrion?,2
1580,ep_6,DAENERYS," He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?",25
1581,ep_6,JON, Forgive him.,2
1582,ep_6,DAENERYS, I can't.,2
1583,ep_6,JON," You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.",18
1584,ep_6,JON," Please, Dany.",2
1585,ep_6,DAENERYS, We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.,21
1586,ep_6,JON, The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.,13
1587,ep_6,DAENERYS, And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.,17
1588,ep_6,JON, How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?,11
1589,ep_6,DAENERYS, Because I know what is good. And so do you.,10
1590,ep_6,JON, I don't.,2
1591,ep_6,DAENERYS, You do. You do. You've always known.,7
1592,ep_6,JON, What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.,14
1593,ep_6,DAENERYS, They don't get to choose.,5
1594,ep_6,DAENERYS," Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20. We do it together. We break the wheel together.",49
1595,ep_6,JON," You are my queen. Now, and always.",7
1598,ep_6,SANSA, Where's Jon?,2
1599,ep_6,SANSA, So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.,13
1600,ep_6,SANSA," If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.",28
1601,ep_6,YARA, Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.,18
1602,ep_6,SANSA, You swore to follow a tyrant.,6
1603,ep_6,YARA," She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.",29
1604,ep_6,ARYA, Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.,12
1605,ep_6,DAVOS," Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?",17
1606,ep_6,DAVOS," If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.",83
1607,ep_6,TYRION, It's not for you to decide.,6
1608,ep_6,TYRION, (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.,33
1609,ep_6,TYRION, You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.,9
1610,ep_6,EDMURE, My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst--,62
1611,ep_6,SANSA, Uncle? Please sit.,3
1612,ep_6,SAMWELL, Why just us?,3
1613,ep_6,SAMWELL," Um-- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.",33
1614,ep_6,EDMURE, Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.,10
1615,ep_6,EDMURE, I suppose you want the crown.,6
1616,ep_6,TYRION," Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her. Can't think of a worse choice.",25
1617,ep_6,DAVOS," Who, then?",2
1618,ep_6,TYRION, I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.,20
1619,ep_6,TYRION," What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?",102
1620,ep_6,SANSA, Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.,11
1621,ep_6,TYRION," Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.",27
1622,ep_6,TYRION," From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.",26
1623,ep_6,TYRION," I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?",46
1624,ep_6,BRAN, Why do you think I came all this way?,9
1625,ep_6,TYRION, To Brandon of House Stark I say aye.,8
1626,ep_6,SAMWELL, Aye.,1
1627,ep_6,EDMURE, Aye.,1
1628,ep_6,ROBIN, Aye.,1
1629,ep_6,YARA, Aye.,1
1630,ep_6,GENDRY, Aye.,1
1631,ep_6,DAVOS," I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.",9
1632,ep_6,BRIENNE, Aye.,1
1633,ep_6,SANSA," I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.",58
1634,ep_6,TYRION," All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",27
1635,ep_6,ALL, All hail Bran the Broken!,5
1636,ep_6,BRAN, Lord Tyrion you will be my Hand.,7
1637,ep_6,TYRION," N-- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.",8
1638,ep_6,BRAN, And I don't want to be king.,7
1639,ep_6,TYRION," I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.",28
1640,ep_6,BRAN, I choose you.,3
1641,ep_6,BRAN," Yes, I can. I'm king.",5
1642,ep_6,BRAN, He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.,20
1644,ep_6,TYRION, Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.,30
1645,ep_6,JON, There's still a Night's Watch?,5
1646,ep_6,TYRION, The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.,12
1647,ep_6,JON, (sighs),1
1648,ep_6,TYRION," You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.",58
1649,ep_6,JON, Was it right? What I did?,6
1650,ep_6,TYRION, What we did.,3
1651,ep_6,JON, It doesn't feel right.,4
1652,ep_6,TYRION, Ask me again in 10 years.,6
1653,ep_6,JON, I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.,9
1654,ep_6,TYRION, I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.,25
1655,ep_6,JON, (nods),1
1657,ep_6,SANSA, I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?,11
1658,ep_6,JON," The North is free, thanks to you.",7
1659,ep_6,SANSA, But they lost their king.,5
1660,ep_6,JON, Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.,14
1661,ep_6,JON," You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.",10
1662,ep_6,ARYA, I can't.,2
1663,ep_6,JON, You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?,10
1664,ep_6,ARYA, (chuckles) I'm not going back north.,6
1665,ep_6,SANSA, Where are you going?,4
1666,ep_6,ARYA, What's west of Westeros?,4
1667,ep_6,JON, (chuckles) I don't know.,4
1668,ep_6,ARYA, No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.,13
1669,ep_6,JON, You have your Needle?,4
1670,ep_6,ARYA, Right here.,2
1671,ep_6,JON, Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.,11
1672,ep_6,BRAN, You were exactly where you were supposed to be.,9
1675,ep_6,TYRION, That's not-- Uh--,3
1676,ep_6,TYRION, What's this?,2
1677,ep_6,SAMWELL, A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.,24
1678,ep_6,TYRION, I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.,9
1679,ep_6,SAMWELL," Oh, I wouldn't say that.",5
1680,ep_6,TYRION," Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed.",8
1681,ep_6,TYRION, He's not kind?,3
1682,ep_6,SAMWELL, He -,2
1683,ep_6,TYRION, He what? What does he say about me?,8
1684,ep_6,SAMWELL," I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.",6
1685,ep_6,TYRION, Your Grace.,2
1686,ep_6,DAVOS, Your Grace.,2
1687,ep_6,BRONN, Your Grace.,2
1688,ep_6,SAMWELL, Your Grace.,2
1689,ep_6,BRAN, We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.,19
1690,ep_6,TYRION," Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.",17
1691,ep_6,BRAN, And Drogon? Any word?,4
1692,ep_6,SAMWELL," He was last spotted flying east, toward--",7
1693,ep_6,BRONN," The farther away, the better.",5
1694,ep_6,BRAN, Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.,11
1695,ep_6,TYRION," As you wish, Your Grace.",5
1696,ep_6,BRIENNE, Ser Podrick.,2
1697,ep_6,TYRION," (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.",26
1698,ep_6,SAMWELL, Long may he reign.,4
1699,ep_6,DAVOS, Long may he reign.,4
1700,ep_6,BRIENNE, Long may he reign.,4
1701,ep_6,BRONN, Long may he reign.,4
1702,ep_6,TYRION, That will improve.,3
1703,ep_6,BRAN, (smiling) I'm sure it will.,5
1704,ep_6,TYRION," Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?",28
1705,ep_6,BRONN," In full, my lord Hand.",5
1706,ep_6,TYRION, Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?,22
1707,ep_6,BRONN, Indeed we can.,3
1708,ep_6,TYRION," Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.",12
1709,ep_6,DAVOS, We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.,20
1710,ep_6,BRONN," The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.",30
1711,ep_6,DAVOS," ""Any more.""",2
1712,ep_6,BRONN, You Master of Grammar now too?,6
1713,ep_6,SAMWELL," Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.",25
1714,ep_6,SAMWELL, The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out--,13
1715,ep_6,BRONN, The strong live and the weak don't.,7
1716,ep_6,TYRION, Find the best builders and set them to the task.,10
1717,ep_6,BRONN," Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.",19
1718,ep_6,SAMWELL, Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.,13
1719,ep_6,BRONN," Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.",8
1720,ep_6,BRIENNE, I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.,12
1721,ep_6,BRONN, I think that's a very presumptuous statement.,7
1722,ep_6,TYRION, I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.,11
